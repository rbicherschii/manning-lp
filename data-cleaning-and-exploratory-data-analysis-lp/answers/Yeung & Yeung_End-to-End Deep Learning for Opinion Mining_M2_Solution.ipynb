       "23                                 I do agree that GN4's pen is infinitely better than Notability's pen - I use Notability to record my class tutorials and write on the slides because of its smooth, continuous vertical scrolling, but writing my revision notes is 1000% more comfortable, enjoyable, and neat on GN4. I love being able to set exactly the thickness I want, whereas with Notability the smallest is too small for me, and the second smallest is too big, for both ball point and fountain. I have no idea why, but the writing in GN4 also just feels smoother and more responsive. Don't get me wrong, I love Notability, but GN4 is just that little bit better for me.\\n\\nI have downloaded GN5 but haven't played with it yet, but I'll be very disappointed if the pen feels like Notability's, because that's one of GN4's biggest advantages over Notability for me. The other is their highlighting, since it goes under text instead of over.\n",

I'll give it a solid try for a week or two before I make any firm judgements, and maybe in the end if a lot of people complain about it (and many people seem to think this release was rushed), they might fix it and we'll all be happy.\n",

Something feels off as I’m writing. I noticed that the ink fades in from the tip of the Apple Pencil rather than solidly appearing. Which is distracting. When I write a fast line, the distance between the line to the Apple Pencil is almost twice as far as it was before. It feels like writing on a 60FPS iPad instead of a 120FPS Pro Motion iPad.

I came to this thread solely to look for a comment/thread like this! I also think that my Goodnotes 4 writing/pen was somewhere between 0.3mm and 0.4mm and I can't hit that sweet spot in Goodnotes 5. I've personally identified the change to be the fact that I feel like I no longer hold as much control in Goodnotes 5 as I did in 4 (in terms of the thickness of my handwriting and the speed), making it look messy overall. I will say though, after extensive notetaking I feel like I could get used to it, but it's not ideal. I guess we'll see if there's an update/change in the near future! I prefer Goodnotes 5's UI, organization so much more it's worth getting used to the pen for em!\n",

They said that they didn’t want to delay releasing GN5, so they shipped it without those features. I strong feel as though they should have warned people in the beginning that some features were missing from GN5 but that they were planning on adding them later. That would prevent a lot of people raging on GN thinking they had removed useful features and could have prevented things like your case. Oh well!\n",

       "15  I just got Goodnotes 5 and I was so excited for vertical scrolling only to be completely disappointed by the inking behaviour. I had previously switched from Notability because I didn’t like their inking behaviour... and now the pen in Goodnotes 5 feels just like Notability’s. Am I the only one who’s feeling this way?\\n\\nI’m not sure exactly what is wrong but I think it might be because there is too much variation in stroke thickness with pressure. I don’t want to completely disable the effects of pressure, but right now, the current fountain pen is just horrible. I always used the 1.9 unit thickness in Goodnotes 4, but in Goodnotes 5 the units of thickness has changed and I can not find a thickness that is equivalent to the old pen (maybe between the new 0.3 and 0.4 mm). \\n\\nCould we please have the option to revert to the old inking behaviour? :( for once I am glad that they released a completely new app because I can still use Goodnotes 4, but I have been waiting so long for vertical scrolling.    \n",

Both the fountain and brush pens are beautiful.\\n\\nTry the ball pen.   \n",

I.e if you zig zag you’ll see ink building up at the changes of direction where the pen slowed down.\\n\\nI do agree they dialed up the velocity effect a bit high, and would be good to have a slider that can vary this (similar to Procreate brush customisation).   \n",
