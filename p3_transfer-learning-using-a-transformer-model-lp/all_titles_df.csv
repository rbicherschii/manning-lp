"Thank you for the new firmware update. It adds some very useful features.

Is there any way that you could add pressure sensitivity adjustment/calibration in a future update? I have several styli which I find more comfortable than the Supernote stylus and the default pressure sensitivity is far too high for them. 

Also, in a previous firmware version, the button on a Lamy EMR stylus triggered the selection erase tool when held down. It now does nothing. Can this be re-instated as it was a very useful feature? The eraser on other styli still works fine.

Thanks We are happy that you can enjoy this firmwares update, and your opinion is important to us.

"Since A6X is on Android, I *supposed* we can install Microsoft OneNote app, and take notes directly into MS OneNote.  Supernote, can you please comment if this is possible? Yes, As it's an Android device, you may do that. But you have to wait a few months. At the beginning, we will block any third-party APP until A6X runs stability.

And I should inform you that handwriting latency will increase by using OneNote. Because of slow refresh rate of E Ink Screen, Supernote's note app access the display layer directly. We call this EPA technology (EPaper Accelerator) while OneNote does nothing special for that.

We will not exclude attempts to install third-party applications, and we will establish an application store to encourage users to help us collect applications suitable for ink screens.

For us, our main goal is to develop note-taking application, which needs to be adapted to the disadvantages of gray scale display, low refresh rate and so on. It should perform better than other apps while runs on E Ink Device.

So I think you will have opportunity to try both solutions, from MS or from ours. :) Hi Bruce!

Thanks for the transparent insight :) I agree about your view about the technology and the consumer demands and I hope that your decision will pay off.

One of my concerns with Android as an OS of choice is the latency. Can you say that there will be no decrease in latency (even better, an improvement) with using Android? (The EPA tech sounds great!)

Also, as it is an Android-based software, is it okay to expect some basic functionalities as Web browser, keyboard pairing, etc?

I am really happy that your company is very communicative. Can't wait to join the fam! (would be super cool if you'd have a EU warehouse ;) ) Appreciate the communication and transparency in this.  :)

Perhaps another way for me would be to OCR it in A6X's note taking app, and then export it to OneNote then. This is a good idea!  If we plan to export doc/docx format, why not add one more format as OneNote. We will check that if we can do.",Will A6X be able to sync to Microsoft OneNote?,title prediction
"Is there a reason that Supernote have sent 8 emails about their A6X pre-order offer in the last 30 minutes? There doesn’t appear to be an option to unsubscribe either, which is a bit naughty these days?

Personally, although I really do want to get a Supernote A6X , I’m not going to pre-order anything until I see something a bit more concrete than some screen shots. Not the most thought-out piece of sales literature. Where are the specs, has the latency improved, what are the differences between A6 and A6X...... anything?!  Eight emails,  It's very high treatment. I think they see you as a big buyer. :) We should say sorry, It seems they send everyone 8 emails... It's our mistake.

"Anyone else feel that they are really missing the ability to search for a specific word in their handwritten notes?

I primarily would use this device to take meeting notes. That is the reason Im holding back from buying at this point. SUPERNOTE doesn't have the ability to search hand written notes at this time. However the A6X migth have the ability when it comes out but for mi used I think is too small I need the A5 with that fuction. I really think that constraint is that they don't have OCR readily on their Linux OS (on the other hand, it's one of the main features of the Remarkable). As a consequence, one cannot really map the handwriting to the alphabets for searching..

Prolly also that the software is originally introduced in Chinese/Japanese, so English support is minimal.

Maybe Android will change things as there are lots existing solutions out there. Let's see =) But do you personally feel that you need to search through your notes sometimes? Of course! It's also on my wish list as well. But I could imagine it not being on the top of their priority especially the introduction of the new OS.

"Was quite interested in getting an A5 but was really put off by the fact that there is no way of returning an opened device. I have bought devices in the past that might have worked well for others but just didn't suit me. And so, in less than a few days, they were returned. Given that there is no place for me to try the device, I think it's pretty unfortunate there is no return option. I understand they are a small company that's just starting out but I'd also have been okay if they charged a restocking fee. 

How do you guys feel about their no return policy? Just wanted some different perspectives. I understand your concerns. Our marketing department will internally discuss the return policy in order to better serve our users, especially those early customers who find us. Thank you very much for kind understanding.

As for return policy, we assume Supernote buyers are familiar with E-paper device and operation system and here are reasons we put the policy.

Some customers had impulse buy with less consideration of the need they really want. We would like to avoid such lose-lose result.

We have been suffering by free return policy for some surprising reasons, such as

\- The display size is too small or too big

\- No color display

\- Just dislike it anymore

\- Need some cash back urgent for other

Please understand that we provide one-year warranty with free replacement and DHL delivery for obvious malfunctions or defects as a responsibility to customers, but we cannot afford for nonsense return. We fully understand that most customers are reasonable and kind, but things keep happening. We are a young company doing all we can to improve our product for people's daily lives.

We know this is never a cheap purchase so we appreciate every customer who places order and uses Supernote to make daily life more efficient and meaningful as our 4F slogan: Feel &amp; Find, Free &amp; Fun. It’s not great, especially when they are expecting customers to purchase, at least at the moment, based on a “goodwill” policy, in that there is hardly any info at all available on the A6X. 
I dunno about anyone else, but I would always try and get as much info as possible on something that was going to cost me several hundreds of pounds, but that info isn’t available. I really do understand that there will be timewasters, people who don’t like the colour, etc, but you’d like to think those were in the minority. The point made about a restocking fee seems fair, perhaps something along the lines of even half the purchase price, so it would sting if you sent it back,(for non-defect reasons, obviously ), but wouldn’t be a complete loss for either side?
I’m waiting for two things before purchasing the A6X, one is more information, videos, specs etc and the other is a European distributor so I don’t end up having to pay a third of the price in shipping and taxes! That's a really disappointing reply that I think you copy/pasted from somewhere else in this thread or your website (so no real discussion?). I have mentioned maybe even instituting a restocking fee to discourage frivolous returns from customers. You haven't addressed that. None of the examples you mentioned (why people return devices) capture the writing experience, that's the one thing we can't test by watching videos. ""the no returns due to a small percentage of potentially bad customers"" approach doesn't reciprocate the goodwill you seem to be expecting from your customers. 

Anyhow, you guys are allowed to run your company however you think is best and I wish you all the best for that.",No returns on opened devices?,title prediction

" Thanks, good share.  I understand Mandarin (Chinese) so here are some takeaways:

Looks like there are some interface changes on the tool bar and also the way the notes are displayed.

10:40 - The Lamy pen feels the same as the 1st generation heart of metal pen (Plastic nib). The reviewer said there's a bit of ""stickiness"" feeling when writing.  He feels that the 2nd generation ceramic nib feels better when writing. 

12:20 - He was comparing the Weixin ebook reading app, I think.  He mentioned the speed seems to be comparable with another ebook reader and looks nice.  Chinese Font on the A6X seems to be smaller and doesn't seem to have a setting to change that in the Chinese ebook reader app he is using.  

13:37 - He mentioned the writing experience is quite good.  Will be continuing further reviews as he uses the A6X in the coming weeks. Thanks so much! I received one. 
I can do a quick video if that helps.

Can confirm the stickiness of the Lamy nib, don’t have ceramic to compare. 

Shout your questions and I’ll answer :) Thanks! :)  Can you please share your experience of the ebook reading?  Things I'm looking at:

\- Table of content

\- Annotations: is it easy (just write directly?)

\- Can you export annotations easily?

\- Can you still draw a line across the screen and then do note taking split screen?

\- Press-and-hold on a word for dictionary (is it available yet)?

"I have a Onyx Boox with note taking from work, but the A6X appeals to me.  However, I've found it very hard to make pencil-like sketches due to the lack of pressure sensitivity to opacity on the Onyx.  Though the brush gets thinner with low pressure, it's still 100% pure black.

Do the Supernotes (or any other note-taking eink device) handle this with opacity as well as brush size?  That would be much more to my liking.  Thanks!

Most of the first pre-orders have been shipped and many customers in Japan, China, Europe and the U.S. have already received the A6 X. We look forward to you sharing your creations on the A6 X!

In the meantime, we have received a lot of feedback and suggestions.

1. The region selection edit tool affects the erasing effect.

2. Margins are too large (EPUB)

3. Confusion caused by two different entrances, the right tag bar and the file manager.

Our team is working on fixing bugs and optimizing the experience, and we look forward to getting more of your feedback and suggestions, as well as feature requests, the A6 X has a lot of room for improvement as a new product, and we want to work with you to make the A6 X even more helpful! Just received the A6X. I thought this was the full Android and could install apps on Play store, but all I see is the notes.

Would appreciate if you have some FAQs on the common workflows and intended uses. Just received mine an hour ago.

Would be nice to have more sizes for tools. I find the leap in 0.3 to 0.6 to be very big for the pen tool. It'd be nice for the highlighter to have different sizes as well. Hello, we've restricted side loading apps to keep the A6 X stable, and we're working on getting apps like Kindle built into the A6 X via firmware updates.

"Hello Supernote,
I was waiting for supernote A5X, but seems that the standard line and X line will still be maintained by you. However, the I feel I will wait forever for the A5X and I was wondering if A5 will have a browser. 

Personally, I want to have one of those eink device to take notes at work, read epub pdf and blogs. So the only think really missing on A5 is the browser.

Any thoughts on that?

(I still feel I will order the A5 and then 1 month later the A5 will be launched) Hello, in our plans the A5 X will most likely have an optimized browser built in. For the A5, it is harder to integrate a browser, but out of concern for our users, we will try out as many solutions as possible, without guaranteeing results. If the browser is crucial to you, ""X"" series could be a better option at this stage. 

Look forward to having you as Supernote owner soon. My need for this device start to be quite urgent. Is there any way I can know how long that wait could be? Are we talking in one month? One year?

"Hi, I've just updated my A6X with the C.063 firmware. Thank you for the correction on the selection tool after the erasing action. It works. 😊

I wanted to tell you I found the following bugs:

- Eraser: with the previous version, when I chosed the ""region eraser"" or used the eraser on the Lamy pen I could delete just a part of a continuos stroke, just the area I selected. With the update I can only erase a complete stroke, even if I select just a part of it. And if I choose the ""regular eraser"" I cannot change its thickness, even if I go to ""pen"", change its thickness and then ""regular eraser"", it is always small.

- Folders: I still find the confusion we had on the previous version, but now I know that if I want to see the files stored in a folder I have to use the side bar, go to Inbox and then select the folder I need. It would be just great if I could see my files even if I choose for example ""Documents"" or ""Notes"" on the side bar and then select the correct folder.

- Png: I don't know why, but when I select a png file, the device tells me ""Unsupported file format"". I can see the thumbnail, but can't open it. It happened also with the previous version.

I know you are working hard on further updates, so maybe you are able to add some of these amendments.
And thank you for this amazing device! Hey there,

Thank you for your detailed feedback.

Eraser: To improve user-friendliness, we are optimizing the region erasing algorithm for a smarter approach.

Folders: in this release we have only tweaked the UI to reduce confusion and will bring subsequent improvements in later updates.

"I’m looking for a device for note taking at work. We have meetings that are chock full of ideas, with lots of people talking.  So I need the ability to sign keywords to notes after the meeting and then be able to convert those words to text and search them. Can the supernote do this? If not, it won’t be any better for me than the current stack of notebooks where I can’t find anything. Hi there. As far as I know, the conversion of handwritten notes using the western alphabet is still under development (at least in the A5 device). The device works properly for Chinese and Japanese only. One option to go around this problem is to use the star mark. You basically draw a star on a page and the device recognizes it. After, you can search for star marks in any note document you have and it will display small sized pages where you have a star. Therefore, if you underline some important keyword on a page with one of these marks, you can find that word with no problem. So it's still better than a regular paper notebook. Also consider that you don't have to use paper or carry tons of notebooks with you. Everything is in one device. It is fast, good to write on, and everything is tidy and accessible.
I have been using A5 device everyday for roughly a month now. I use it as a notebook and (mostly) as a PDF reader. Besides the very good writing experience, fast processing, etc., the best part is that I don't use paper anymore and everything is cleaned and organized from the beginning. I would recommend it.
That being said, if you really need a handwritten notes conversion function and don't want to tackle the problem by the means that supernote offers, there may be other devices on the market more suitable for you. Yes, we have the same idea as you. So we made a similar function in A6X. My colleague will post a video later, please confirm if this is what you want.

Once this function is approved by our users, we will apply it to A5/A6. Hi there, you can convert your handwriting to text and set it to keywords for easy searching and indexing.

"Do you guys think that this would be possible? I use OneNote for **a lot** of things and it would be so awesome if SuperNote could sync with them. :-)

I thought of this after my integration with Dropbox completely broke on my A5. Maybe another idea would be to add more slots for quick access? I keep a lot of my notebooks separate and having more than 4 items in the quick access bar would be a gamechanger for me. If this feature comes through Supernote would make an immediate impact on the professionals market (potentially grabbing a chunk of it from iPad). I see OneNote used in the industry a lot, yet very few who use it write up the notes on iPad. In my area we use ordinary notebooks and then retype the notes in OneNote (it is considered unprofessional to type notes in a customer meeting). If I had this sync - that would be the feature I'd be using hte most.  


The key thing though - it should support the corporate sharepoint accounts somehow (OneNote can use sharepoint as the sync backend). Completely agree! None of these devices have that functionality so it would really cater to a very specific target market. Posted this sometime back.  They replied:

"I have had a Supernote A5 for close to two months now, and overall I love it. It has changed the way I work and has made me much more productive.

 However I have been surprised at the poor quality of the images in exported notes. It seems like they export as raster images at the same resolution as the Supernote screen. When I view them on a larger, higher-resolution computer screen the lines look very jagged and pixelated, and zooming in on a note makes this worse (see the attached doodle).

Is there a reason that Supernote does not export to PDF with a vector-based image, like I believe the reMarkable does? I believe this would help the notes look much more legible and clear when read on a computer.

"I wish to use one for home and another for work, but would like both to sync from the same Dropbox account.

I mainly use notes and would like notes to sync on both devices. Interesting question. How do you think the sync should work? My understanding of the sync process is that it doesnt sync unless i explicitly pulldown then top nav bar and hit the sync button.

So, for simplicitly/Minimum Viable Product, i think they should let the end users control sync i.e. if there is a sync conflict (i.e server file updated by another device), they provide the option to a) retain file on device, overwrite on server (cloud) b) retain file on server, overwrite on device. Yes,you can.
And one more thing need to know is that  a6x is trying a new note file format which differently with ""none x"" series(A5,A6). So if you sync one of A5/A6 type with another of A6X type. Each one would fail to open the note file created by another.

"Just got the A6X today and I have to say that as a person who much prefers pen over pencil, it is really nice to write with. I've had the rM1 for about 4 months now and here's my initial thoughts comparing the two. (Background - I'm part designer and researcher and I make things with my hands so I'm very sensitive to the tools I use)

Screen - I thought that the A6X's 300dpi screen would mean that the lines I write would be less pixelated and smoother-looking than the 226dpi of the rM tablet but that's not the case. 

Size - I thought the smaller 7.8"" diagonal screen size would feel like I'm losing out on screen real estate. I don't feel that way because of the finer tip on the pen. The size is more portable than the rM dimensions and I feel like I can take it everywhere with me.

Pen - It's a comfortable weight to write with. The style reminds me of the Pilot Razor Point felt tip pen that I used to use a lot. The finer nib and the feeling that I can press as hard as I need to is mentally relieving. I did not realize how hard I write until I've switched back to pen and paper after using the rM1. The standard rM1 marker feels to me like trying to write with a hollow plastic tube. I also have the LAMY AL-Star and that feels too bulky for my medium-large hand with skinny long fingers. Sometimes when I press the button on it a short line appears out of nowhere on the rM1. I don't have any mods on my rM1.

Writing feel - Wow. Everyone's been saying it's hard to describe. Here's my attempt. My go-to paper for writing is very smooth, about 25% of the way to glossy paper, and I usually use the Muji retractable pen, the one that looks like the Sarasa retractable pen, 0.5mm. It's a ballpoint. Compared to that, writing on the A6X is like if the ballpoint is not rolling, but instead it's gliding. The sound of writing is quieter than the rM, which is quieter than pen on paper. It sounds like you're writing on paper with a smooth paper texture, but that's if you're writing with a light hand. The harder you press down, you'll get less of that scratchy sound. When you first put the pen to the A6X screen, you'll hear a tap sound kind of like Apple Pencil on iPad but quieter. It's louder if you're holding the pen at an angle, and quieter if you're writing on it such that the pen is tangent to the surface (or orthogonal or uhhh straight down for the laymen terms). The rubber texture provides more resistance the harder you press when writing. If you press too hard, it's a lot of friction. But that means that you get more haptic feedback if you're going slow and trying to be precise in your lines. If you're pressing hard and want to write fast, it's gonna feel like too much friction. On that note, I can see the indent of the lines on the screen surface when I write hard and it quickly disappears. So that's good. 

Colors - the A6X has 4 colors. White, light gray, dark gray, and black. I don't see myself using the white one very much. Compared to the rM1 which has white, gray, and black (and light gray for highlighter), this means that I can use the A6X for planning website layouts. Light gray would be content boxes and then darker gray can be non-text content. I would fill in actual content with black. 

Switching between tools - It's nice that it's only one tap to switch to the highlighter or marker(?) on the A6X. On the rM1, this requires two taps and then reading from the list to pick what you want to use. Unless you've got the positions all memorized. For me, this means that it is faster to write headings and highlight important content so that I can structure my notes clearly and visually. 

Interface and some features - It's not as obvious how to get to the Settings menu like on the rM interface. You have to know to swipe down from the top and the mini tutorial at the beginning does not cover that. I love the lasso select text as a heading for a table of contents. That way, I don't have to look through the pages to find what I'm looking for. Compared to the rM1, this means that I will not have to create a new notebook for each topic or subtopic. I can just select the text to be a header. 

Cover - I got the default cover. The front cover feels a bit too lightweight and it wiggles around easily. I can see where the round magnet is on the inside of the front cover, which is not a problem. 

Questions - 

1. I'm trying to sync with Dropbox. There's no new folder on my Dropbox or I can't find it. Do I need to have a Supernote account for this to work? I'm hoping I don't need that. 

2. I'd like to use the nib in a different pen chassis. I was able to unscrew the front piece near the tip but can't seem to get the nib out. Can I even do that with this updated ceramic version?

3. I made a test notebook that's just 2 pages of scribbles. Why is it 2MB? I like that it does tell me how big the file is but I imagine if I have 100 pages, it may be 100MB. So about 2000 pages would be 1GB. So the 22GB of user space I have on the A6X would give me like 44,000 pages. Much less than the rM's advertised 100,000 pages on 8GB. 3. I wrote about the file size as well and the support team replied saying that they will fix that issue in future updates. They said that they are well aware of the issue and they have a potential fix that will be part of one of the future updates. 
Hopefully that future update will be before you reach the 44,000 page limit? Lol just kidding 😅 

Enjoy your A6X, I think its a marvelous tool with an equally amazing &amp; very active team behind it. Cheers. Thanks! Glad they’re going to fix the issue. 

I quite enjoy it so far, much more than I have enjoyed my rM1 in the past months. I think I may have found the right one for me. To read your notes in Dropbox, first export them als pdf or png.

"Had a quick question-what type of charger is recommended for charging my A6X to have better battery life. I read in Onyx Boox posts that fast charging was causing lot of battery issues. 

Is it ok to charge my A6X with a fast charger? Or should it be a small charger? Or a computer perhaps (as the package did come just with a cable and no plug 🔌) 

Want to keep my Supernote for ever 😁 A6X support USBPD (the main fast charge standard). It's a negotiation protocol. When plugged, the charger will ask A6X, ""how much current you want?"", and A6X always answer,""1.5A is enough"". So the charger will start supply current limited by the agreement. You need not worry about too much current would damage the device. Typically A6X will get full charged in 2 hours by a 7.5W (or more powerful) PD charger. 

If you want to use a fast charger, please make sure it's PD type.

It's also ok if you use a computer USB port for charge, it will take more time than PD charger, at about 3-6 hours. Because of computer USB port usually limit the current supply at 0.5A-1A level. Perfect explanation! Thank you",Type of Charger to Use,title prediction
"Hi! Question for the supernote team, after the holidays. 

Are any of the following features on the roadmap? (I understand the hardware roadmap is delayed for bug squashing and UI integration across devices, so it could be a while, but would love to know if they’re at least in the works or in planning.)

1. Frontlight (ability to set brightness at the least, ideally also warmth)
2. Waterproof/water resistant

3. Work with calibre wirelessly* (content server or companion app)


* actually, as I’m still having trouble getting my A5 set up to work with my PC at all via usb cable, I’m not 100% sure it works with the calibre desktop software that way. Does it? If not, that’s definitely a feature request, too.  


Thanks! Our holiday is coming to an end, but I have been on duty during the holiday

1. About the front-light.

When the E Ink screen was first put on the market, it was necessary to add an auxiliary light source due to the low contrast. However, the current contrast gets better and does not require front-light. In products whose main purpose is note-taking, removing the front-light is a common way.

However, some brands with a history of making eReaders continue to use front-light. The reason is that it can be used in places without lights, such as at night. My question is why not turn on the lamp?

Our focus is on a good handwriting experience, writing on a shiny screen will not be an enjoyable experience. 

We use the ""hard pen and soft film"" technology to simulate the effect of paper. If the front-light layer is added, the distance from the pen tip to the display layer will increase. So we would rather give up the front-light feature.

2. About waterproofing

We will not use waterproofing on the ""X"" series (A5X/A6X), but we will consider supporting waterproofing on the successor products of the ""non-X"" series

3. About USB

If you use MAC PC, you need to install the software openMTP to support USB connection. If it's not cause by this, please contact our customer service. Thanks for another quick and thorough reply. I’m consistently impressed by your presence in this subreddit.

1. I sometimes like to work and to read in bed while my spouse is asleep. That said, yes, I could leave the bedroom or perhaps use a smaller external book light. That’s a great point about adding a light lessening the writing experience.

2. Interesting, thanks!

3. It’s a laptop running Windows 10. I’ll do a bit more troubleshooting on my end and then reach out if I still can’t figure it out.

Thank you again. I enjoy this work because I like to communicate with others, especially for interesting idea to make product better. Another reason is I want to improve my English skill since I'm from the place where the mother language isn't English.

I'm happy to learn a new phrase ""reach out"" from your message.

So don't be hesitate to reach out with any question:) &gt;Our focus is on a good handwriting experience, writing on a shiny screen will not be an enjoyable experience.

I totally understand this, but the device can \*also\* be used for reading: and improving the reading experience in low light setting can be nice, don't you think so? It would also improve the perceived contrast of the screen (that's the magic behind the ""paperwhite"").

Eink screens did improve, but the background is still kinda grey. With an optimal lighting and a document with good contrast it's fine, but if that's not the case a frontlight can help. A lot. If it can be shut down, what problem would it create? Is the distance to the display layer so big that the writing experience would be really different?

"My boss was enamored enough of my A6X to buy one for herself, and for her birthday I got her a Heart of Metal pen.  She loves it, so here's a review:

""The pen is STURDY.  I don't feel like the cap is going to pop off if I drop it.  It makes a solid ""click"" when snapping it back on and I love that it's thicker than the standard pen because I prefer writing with wider barreled instruments.  It writes just as perfectly as the standard pen.  No charging required.  I don't know how long the nib will last but the packaging included easy instructions for changing it and I've had the standard for months without any degradation so I don't expect to be changing it any time soon.   Fits snugly on the case's loop and I don't worry about it coming off in my bag."" 

So obviously she gives it 5 stars, lol!  I'll be buying one for myself eventually if I get tired of the LAMY one. Totally agree; I also have the HoM pen, bought it along my A5. It solves the problem I had with my previous eink notepad; as an university student, I write a lot and the nibs would wear off way too fast.

"I just got both of these delivered today I was in batch 3 for the remarkable 2

Here are my observations as a notebook doodler. I wanted a device that I could take outside and do some sketching and people studies and just generally be able to do rough logo concepts and first stage illustration layouts, like I usually do in my paper notebook. I am a biro scribbler rather than pencils so... here are my observations.

Surface feel - the biggie :) well remarkable has this won hands down. You start drawing on this and you just smile. Man it really does feel and sound like you are drawing on paper. It is absolutely incredible. The supernote definitely doesn’t feel like paper it feels like writing on rubber or a piece of Lino with a biro, as you press harder you can feel the pen almost carving into the surface. It doesn’t feel bad but it definitely doesn’t feel like paper. So if you are just looking for the most realistic paper feel then go get the remarkable 2

Drawing experience - the remarkable 2 has a large range of pens pencils and a brush. The supernote only has three  - fine liner, the pen (pressure sensitive), and the marker. The remarkable brushes all differ in the types of marks that they create and I have not yet found an absolute favourite but the brush seems very versatile lots of variation between thick and thin strokes and the biro mimics it’s real life counterpart rather well. The pencil is ok and uses tilt for shading but for some reason you can only choose one colour (black). 

Due to the smaller selection on the supernote the choice is pretty easy the pen works the best for me due to the pressure sensitivity and mimics fairly well the results that I get when I am sketching with a biro, I usually use lighter (thinner) strokes for initial forms and then lay down harder (thicker) stroke for final forms this technique also works well here. I hope that supernote include more ‘pens’ soon. I would love a brush that lets you lay down thicker strokes to make full use of the pressure sensitivity. The stylus sensitivity and lag on both are very good, perhaps the remarkable edges it here, but the supernote is very very good too.

Colours (greys) - the remarkable includes only three shades for their ‘pens’ - black, mid grey and white - with the exception of the pencil which as mentioned is only available in black. There is also a highlighter which lays down a lighter grey which is handy. It is also worth mentioning that the highlighter is translucent rather than opaque so you can still see your artwork behind it and the colour gets darker as you lay down subsequent strokes (like a real world marker pen) The supernote includes four colours for each tool - black, dark grey, light grey and white, but doesn’t include a translucent highlighter.

Erasing - where the supernote definitely outshines the remarkable 2 is in its erasing capabilities which you wouldn’t think would be a big thing, but it kinda is. I find it very difficult to see the eraser line on the remarkable and you only see what you have erased when you finish your stroke, so you’re never quite sure what the result is going to be, there seems to be quite a bit of trial and error as to how much of the stroke is erased, which is annoying if you are trying to erase precisely for highlights etc. If you are just using one layer then you can ‘erase’ using a white colour for any of the pens, but if you want to put a shadow layer beneath your main artwork then it kinda messes everything up because you have white opaque ink on the layer above. Supernote on the other hand nails this, the eraser works the same as the brushes, it erases instantly so you can be very precise. Obviously in real life you don’t have multiple layers in your paper notebook but thought it was worth mentioning.

Screen refresh - the remarkable leaves quite noticeable ghosting behind on darker inked areas when you close the tool sub palettes, and I don’t think it’s possible to do a manual screen refresh, although switching a layer visibility off and on seems to do the trick. I haven’t encountered these issues on the supernote but if I did you can swipe up on the sidebar to refresh the screen which is nice.

Size and portability - the remarkable is about the same size as an A4 piece of paper. So the equivalent of an open a5 notepad which is what I usually have in front of me in front of my keyboard when I’m working, so it’s a nice size, to scribble down some sketches or client notes when at work. The supernote may be a little small to jot down a lot of notes or sketches and it is not currently possible to zoom in to the canvas, but is absolutely ideal to pop in your bag and do some al fresco doodling. Another thing to note is that the remarkable 2 has a landscape mode but the supernote doesn’t. So if you are drawing in landscape orientation the toolbar is rotated 90 degrees

Overall feel - I preordered my remarkable 2 and just got the vanilla options so standard pen and sleeve only. So that cost around USD399 plus shipping The supernote a6x was USD 369 plus shipping but the real kick in the pants was the 20% extra you pay on import taxes. So these two devices were practically the same price. 

But when you handle them the remarkable feels like a luxury item and the supernote feels like a fun friendly gadget. I wouldn’t think twice about throwing the supernote in my bag and whipping it out to do some urban sketching, but the remarkable 2 feels a lot more precious and feels like it would be a lot more conspicuous in public places

From a pure sketching point of view it’s difficult to choose between the two. The pen performance on both is equally as good. The sheer size and paper feel make the remarkable great for cracking out development sketches and making  longer form notes at home or the office. The only thing putting a dampener on the experience is the eraser functionality. The size of the supernote makes it very portable and great for urban sketching, single sketches, and shorter notes/lists.

I’m enjoying them both and not sure which will get most use but I have a feeling that I’ll take the supernote everywhere with me, and use the remarkable primarily at my desk or on the sofa.

In summary

Remarkable 2

===========

\+ feels like writing on paper

\+ Premium feeling/looking product

\+ Pen performance is great

\+ Landscape mode

Eraser isn’t very good

===========

\+ Great size for urban sketching

\+ Free folio cover and pen

\+ Pen performance is great

\+ More shades of grey to choose from

\+ Eraser works well

Feels like biro on rubber not paper

Fewer tool to choose from

No zoom

No landscape mode

Maybe too small for development sketches or extensive notes

Hope that helps any doodlers out there Thank you for bringing a so fair and so detailed comparison.

After I read it carefully, I will follow your article from the role of product participant. This is such a great review. Very detailed. I especially agree with you on the size of the A6x. I find myself bringing it everywhere with me because of its size. Great review!

Another point I notice about the Supernote. The bottom end of the pressure curve has no opacity pressure. Only size. So the stroke gets smaller, and then just stops at a certain pressure activation.

On Remarkable, a light touch with the pen has a slight opacity falloff, like a real pen. The pencil even more so. So you can get a lighter half-textured stroke.

But even the Remarkable pen pressure curve doesn’t go to zero. It snaps off at a certain pressure. So if you try and draw an extremely light line, it snaps on and off like a dashed line.

I’d love if both these tablets had a complete drop off to zero on the pressure curve. It would make drawing much better. But with Remarkable, it has a slight edge because it has a bit of opacity falloff too.

Both feel nice though, and I enjoy drawing and writing on both.

Also, sometimes I use the Remarkable stylus on the Supernote. The plastic nib glides very nicely over the rubbery surface! And the stylus is lighter than the Heart of Metal stylus, so it’s a bit easier on my wrist after a while.  Supernote was originally designed for note-taking, so we made HoM into the same shape and weight as a traditional pen.

But when it comes to art, the lighter the better. So we're going to make a special pencil for the artist. It can also be used in other situations. And compatible with all Supernote tablets. This pen will be the default accessory for A5 SLIM, but users can purchase it separately.

"I haven't ordered an A6X yet,  was really hoping for an A5X soon.  I was wondering it anyone is able to test the Trello app for functionality and if it doesn't work is life to put in s request for it. Hello, thank you for your information, we have recorded your request. Could you please describe your use case? I am an engineering consultant. I create buckets for each of my clients and then create cards for each project I'm working on. Inside the cards I add notes from calls, task lists, setup a timeline that gets added to a calendar, etc. Once a project is done I will move the card to Client-Archive bucket. I would suggest you look at getting a regular tablet, like an iPad with a paperly screen protector instead to get a paper-like feel. I don't think this device or other eInk devices can properly support that work flow.

If you want just a Kanban board I'd understand. You could definitely draw up a Kanban template. But a fully functional Trello is excessive for these types of devices. 

Additionally, Trello doesn't support handwriting, so you would be typing everything out anyways, which will be a way slower experience due to eInk. 

Take Onyx Boox for example. They just use fully open android so you can install anything you want. But the performance of the app won't be any good for it. Since they have no control over a third party-apps, nothing can be done other than wait for an upgraded model that can handle it.

"After updating to the most recent A5 software here are some of my thoughts about the changes made to the top menu bar for note taking.

Moving the page number display position in notes to the top menu bar to prevent accidental touches was a definite improvement for my daily workflow. However I feel that the user interface design of the top menu bar still needs a bit more refinement, as I have now lost easy access to a lot of my regularly used menu items such as share &amp; export, templates, and quick access.

I think too much unnecessary space is being taken up by the note/document title (50% or more of the screen width) and the page navigation. By reducing the size of the space and decreasing the font size of the text for the titles, I think at least 3 or 4 of the other more commonly used menu items can be restored to the primary top menu instead of being relegated to the secondary drop down menu list instead.

Curious to know others opinions on the new top menu redesign for the A5. Which menu items do you often use that are now part of the secondary menu options (ooo)? 

Is there any way to customise which menu items are more important for inclusion in the primary top menu by prioritising the items in the same way that tag menu items are ordered in the settings menu?

As always thanks for the regular updates and feedback on questions and issues posted by users. Malcsweb, have you tried to simply double tap anywhere on the screen to hide all menus?  This gives you full screen real a state for writing or document viewing. Thanks but the issue is not about trying to hide menus for writing/reading but suggesting to get rid of empty white space in the title and page navigation section of the NEW top menu to make room for more menu options that used to be there previously. Thank you for your thoughts, this is very helpful. What do you think about the user interaction design of the A6 X? We have piloted a new user interface on the A6 X. The top menu has been redesigned based on the frequency with which users access different menu items. We are still working on this interface and plan to unify the A5, A6 Agile and A6 X once it is complete. Thanks Supernote\_official. Haven't seen the A6X design in detail but from what you described I like the idea of top menu items based on frequency of use. Look forward to seeing this feature in future updates.

The conflict:  I discovered that if you have a document named """"November"" and if you want to change it to ""november"", it says the file already exists. It is not wrong, that s for sure! I thought you might want to know about this capitalization conflict.

The questions:

1. I have never used the Kindle app before and I don t quite understand it. After a quick Google search, I found out that it s more or less a market place for books, but a library for pdfs/their format (epubs?) as well. I also find out that you can buy kindle books for 3rd party shops. I am not interested in the market aspect of it, because there are not many books in my language on their platform, but is there a reason to choose the kindle library over the default Supernote library (the tablet's interface itself)?

2. I just found out about the titling feature of the tablet, but can I use it for PDF s text (lasso -&gt; transform into title)? If not, how could I insert titles that could be recognized by the tablet if we are talking about a PDF that I created? 

3. Because I didn t find a solution to the .2 question, I am using bookmarks. Can i change the ""title"" of the bookmark? Long press doesn t work.

4. I just saw that .word format is available (I don t know if it was available before) and that a lot of functions were implemented for it, especially the zoom function. I was quite sad that I can t zoom in my PDFs, but I found out about the trimming feature for the PDFs files. This is like a zoom, right? Does it have another function?

Thank you so much! Thanks for your feedback. Yes, the system dose not support renaming a file after only changed the case of name. But as you mentioned, we need to change the prompt.

Here are my thoughts on the other points you mentioned:

1. kindle app is used to read the ebooks only from kindle store. 

2. We support the handwriting title to make the note file structured and indexable. because many user's note increased to dozens of pages, they need a easy way locate the page quickly.

"Just following up with a question I saw someone else had. A major use case for me to buy into an e-ink note taking device is to be able to skip a step when taking notes. The conversion of my handwritten notes to text that I can eventually turn into more coherent documents. Is handwriting to text in the pipeline for implementation? It's a fashion. But according to our test, handwriting recognition will limit the fun and freedom of notes, and even slow down the writing speed (in order to ensure the recognition rate). So we will support this feature, but the priority is not high. And handwriting recognition will first be applied in some partial features, such as keyword recognition, and the text insertion in the doc revision function that will be released in the next update. The function of ""entire handwriting recognition and import into DOC/TXT"" will be implemented at the end.

This is not a technical problem, but a difference in product concepts. That's good to know it is something that can be implemented. Thank you for actually responding, even if I am disappointed in the answer.

But wouldn't that improve the functionality and fun of a note taking device? I don't think it has to be done simultaneously, but if I'm using the supernote  to take notes during an interview, a meeting, or a lecture, which seems like a pretty common use-case, it would so helpful to be able to export my handwritten notes afterwards into a text document. I don't think it has to be live. It could even be something you schedule to do when the device isn't being used. It would add a practical element to something that is fun! 

For example. As part of an ideation process, I could be brainstorming something on my device, have it exported to an md, docx, or txt file, share with a colleague for feedback, and then I could review/annotate it back on my device. It would just eliminate a step of doing a manual conversion!

If it isn't a technical problem, you could implement it in a way that fits with your intentions for the devices. But if Nova and other note-taking eink/tablet can do it, its a bit unfortunate this one chooses not to. Especially when your devices seem to offer such good features in other ways! It seems like the devices are so close to what I want, and I may still buy one, but not having this available in the foreseeable future is a reason not to jump in, yet.

Either way, thanks again for replying and being transparent, even if I don't agree. Until I can justify a device, I wish the team continued success! If you output TXT/DOC in a calm environment, you will find the keyboard is the most efficient.  If you take notes in interviews or meetings, you will find that your writing needs to keep up with other people's speeches, which leads to scribbling.  Some sketches are even mixed in to make the description more intuitive.  These all increase the difficulty of identification.  If you have really used similar software, you will find that the effect may not be as good as you think.  We are not opposed to full text recognition.  We just tend to accumulate some assistive technology and then do this.  For example, how to distinguish between sketches and characters. Because once we start to do this, we must ensure that it is really effective, not just a marketing video in an ideal state. Yes indeed a keyboard would be more efficient, but for many reasons, not always viable. Hence a note-taking device can fill the need. It's good point that hand notes tend to also include sketches or special characters, like those in mathematical equations or flow charts or cluster maps. It is reassuring that it seems that there is a focus on delivering a clever bit of software as the goal. However, you did say earlier that it wasn't technically difficult. So now I'm confused.

Either way, it seems this functionality will be added, perhaps more in the future, but when it does, I think your software and products will become a lot more attractive to people like me, or academics, analysts, jotters, or creatives. The original point of my question was whether it was in the roadmap of functionality. I'm glad to see it is, disappointed it isn't as much of a priority, so now I'm hoping that when it does become a feature, that it was worth the wait",Handwriting to text,title prediction
"Hello guys! I'm wondering if A6X can handle pdfs (scanned books) well. I'm a bit worried about the screen size. I heard there's crop function but is that enough to read small texts?

How's your experience?

The only part that I don t like about the crop function is the fact that it takes the ""note space"" away, but I believe you can ""\[ \]"" and make notes inside that - look into the user manual for this. 0:46 - PDF articles.

"It would be wonderful to be able to borrow free ebooks from my public library right from A5. I know other linux based e-reader devices can do this, e.g. Kobo.  I wonder if other A5 users would like this feature?  And....Is there any chance that Ratta engineers can integrate Overdrive or Libby into the A5 platform. OverDrive seems only support  ios/android. So you may get other resource, such as gutenberg project.  [https://www.gutenberg.org/](https://www.gutenberg.org/)  You may download the ebooks from the website and than transfer to your A5. Thank you hex2asc.  I appreciate your prompt reply.  I will try this.  

But, please allow me to ask another question.  I am not a programmer, so my knowledge is very limited in this area.  And I probably don’t know that I don’t know.   Nevertheless, when I was researching e-ink tablets, I selected the A5 because of the stability of Linux OS, which runs my wonderful A5.  I understand that Kobo e-readers also run on Linux.  How can they incorporate Overdrive, and not the A5 if hey are both on the same platform?  Is it because e-readers are fundamentally different from e-ink tablets? You like to ask why, which makes me have to check the usage of OverDrive.

I found that Kobo has developed an interface specifically for OverDrive, so Kobo can directly connect to OverDrive to browse and read eBooks. But for other eReaders, there will be some complexity, Users need to install the software ADE (Adobe Digital Editions) on PC/Mac . We can to vist the OverDrive website by PC browser, and then download the eBook, and then transfer the book to the e-reader.

We have not tried to connect to ADE,  we will learn more and try. I am grateful that you looked into it and even considering the request.  Best wishes.",Feature request: Overdrive on the the Linux A5 platform.,title prediction
"Is A6X more abrasive than Oynx on the pen? If I use the same pen (Lamy Al Star) on both of them, will the nib wear be the same? I am not sure about the nib wear, but i believe the nib you would use on both devices are different. Due to the surface coating on the A6X, the nib is harder compare to the nib you would use for Onyx.  


So if you do reuse a pen between the two devices, you would have to swap nibs before using. Thanks for the answer. Is it possible just to buy the nib for A6X from somewhere? Supernote devices have a built in screen protector that is much more pliable than Onyx (or any other e ink device).  The pen that comes with Supernote devices has a ceramic tip that never needs to be replaced.  It can only be used with Supernote devices - if you use it on any other type of device it will scratch the surface.

You can also get an upgraded package from Supernote that includes a Lamy Al Star EMR.  The nib on that is plastic and will need to be replaced.  Because the Supernote screen is more pliable than other devices, it's possible that nibs will last longer when used on that device versus other ones.

I purchased the A6X with the stock pen (ceramic nib) and it works great.  I also have a Lamy - but I use reMarkable nibs in it.  The stock Lamy nib on the Supernote felt too slippery.  The reMarkable nibs work great and have a better writing feel in my opinion.

I also have the Noris Digital Jumbo, and absolutely love the writing feel of that on the A6X.  I usually switch between the Noris and Lamy because I love both of them.

Based on a recent video from Voja ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgj5Y7NHY74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgj5Y7NHY74)) about the best pen and nib combinations for e ink devices, I have ordered the Samsung Tab S6 Lite pen and  HP ZBOOK X2 nibs.  Can't wait for those to come in.  On a side note, I also can't wait to order an A5X :D I had an Onyx Boox Max 3 and sent it back. Now I have a Supernote A6X. The A6X is far better than the Max 3 for the writing feel with the Lamy pen (with lamy standard nibs). The Supernote Pen is better than the Boox pen too.

"I use the Scribd app for ebooks and audiobooks. It is a service that is dying for an ereader but alas there isn't one. A partnership between Scribd and Supernote would be innovative! Copy that. Partnerships are both good and bad. How many devices do we  buy with preloaded applications we never wanted and can never get rid of? 

Is okay to offer it, but also allow the customer to delete it. The last thing Supernote needs is a application to Scribd that can never be removed by the customer.

Example, I dislike Facebook and never use it. But I can't uninstall it from my Samsung Note 9. I can turn it off, but it's always there. Very good points, I totally agree. I agree. I like the Kindle app on Supernote A6X - it works great on the e-ink screen and provides an option to read purchased books on an already excellent note taking device.

Having Scribd would provide a 'Netflix for books' like option to supplement Kindle's traditional book buying option and, for me, would complete the e-ink device experience.

I agree with another poster that too many apps would be cumbersome and detract from Supernote's streamlined user experience. If someone wants unlimited flexibility to download apps, Likebook and Onyx are options. I'm happy they picked Kindle and stuck with it instead of adding Kobo and Play Books and all the other alternatives. (I'd similarly be fine if they had picked a different store front - too many choices weigh down the user interface. Better to have one and stick with it.)

"Would it be possible to have a tools menu accessible in full screen mode? I like full screen for writing, but it is annoying to have to exit full screen to pull up the tool bar. Yes, a floating tool bar/bubble is comming in near update. Any chance of getting the A5 functionality of double tapping to go in and out of full screen? In the early design, we used a lot of hidden interactive functions. For example, double-click to enter/exit the full screen. Swipe from the side to the center of the screen to call the writing toolbar. Long press the file name to enter file delete/move/copy operations, etc. These designs make the interface more concise, but also cause some side effects. Most users will not read the user manual carefully (of course I do too), and they will complain if they don't know what to do. So in the later design, we try to avoid hiding functions, but it may be overkill.

" I know the Ratta team has a lot on their plates but hopefully this is something that can  be addressed in future software updates. I think both the rM and Supernote look as unclean as they do because of how note-taking on the devices themselves is the main selling point, and so to the creators of these eNote devices, export comes after that. Not saying that the exports should not look crisp, but it bears repeating what the primary intention of each device is to help understand where these young products stand. As for whether or not they're dealbreakers is up to the consumer.

In addition, Onyx Boox products tend to be somewhere in-between eNote and a full-blown eInk Android device, which is why they have the best of both worlds for software.

"After searching high and low, did you know, not a single note taking device or application offers hand recognition spelling checking. Not a single one.

If the device or application can do OCR for hand writing, then it could also spell check too. Normally OCR keeps some index of the words written to search against. That index could also be scanned against a dictionary. If the word is not found in the dictionary, the device or application could highlight or tag the word as misspelled. It's up to the developers of the tool offers spelling options or corrections.

I've put the same challenge to Goodnotes application team for the iPad. As I said, no one offers this feature yet. 

So depending if Supernote or Goodnotes implements first, then that's what I'm going with. My needs are simple, OCR for text search and spell checking. I posted before I finished. For OCR the possibilities really multiply. With standard text you can offer translation services.

Also, some people love writing notes, but they don't like their handwriting. So if you introduced OCR with font replacement, you can help those folks make beautiful notes. Write a word, and OCR picks up the word, and then replaces the word with nice font

Ratta might think of selling add-ons too. So everything I mentioned could be an additional extra folks could buy /unlock. No different that Goodnotes / Notability or other note taking apps.

If the difference between having full OCR with search and spelling check is extra $40, then that is worth it to me.

I hate subscriptions though. Have you checked out MyScript Nebo? I use it for long form writing (just straight up writing text, no drawings). It's on android and iOS and can convert your handwriting to text as you write. Just double-tap to convert. And it's easy to edit the text that's already been converted. Your handwriting style does not get saved. 

It can then export the text to different formats or other apps. I like to use it with Day One which is awesome for journaling. 

Doing long form writing on the Supernote feels like a lot of handwritten text that I have to review and type out if I want to make any good use of it. We have 3 goals

1 Make the note orgnized by original handwriting titles that can help user locate the page quickly. like ""table of contents"" of MS DocX.  Without any recognition. This is more free, you can set anything as titile, words, symbols,etc...

2 Can modify the DocX by handwriting. 

3 Can recogination entie page of handwring smartly(Able to distinguish between text and sketches) and output to Text/MarkDown/DocX.

"I was wondering if Supernote has any plans to support RemNote in X series (as RemNote is available as an android app) (see \[1\] below for further details on RemNote).

I think it would be quite useful to have an advanced note-management app (like RemNote, Obsidian, Roam research, Insight, etc) available in supernote directly; among these, RemNote is free and has an android app (btw I'm not affiliated with RemNote or anything, I just find it extremely efficient. See \[2\] for my use case).

I'm not sure whether this is a niche use case or whether there are a lot of supernote esers who would use this if it was available, so I'd appreciate if the community chimes in. Also, I'm tagging u/hex2asc : I'd appreciate if the Chief Chat Officer informs us to if there is any such plan :)  
\------

\[1\] For those who do not know, RemNote is a ""note-taking"" platform/app. It uses science-backed methods to ensure efficient learning (such as spaced-repetition, bi-directional linking, flashcards, etc).   Please see [https://www.remnote.io](https://www.remnote.io) for further details. There are several such platforms (RemNote in my opinion is most balakned, and is also free), for a nice comparison see these youtube videos [https://youtu.be/M2U61vHfQSQ](https://youtu.be/M2U61vHfQSQ) , [https://youtu.be/opSENgc45Sw](https://youtu.be/opSENgc45Sw) .

\[2\] I'm a PhD student in physics, and I use RemNote regularly to take both my academic notes and my daily scribbles . I  do not own a supernote right now, but I'll be buying a5x ---actually I would buy it right now while it is discounted but unfortunately I'm currently not in US and will not be back till the end of next month. I plan to use supernote to read papers (mostly arxiv stuff). I would definitely use this if it were available. I am not sure how feasible it would be though without the addition of an external keyboard. Part of the beauty of Remnote is how quickly one can enter and arrange data with keyboard shortcuts. But maybe I'm just too used to using it on my laptop to envision a new implementation.

Now, if only there were a way to have all of Remnote's features in a handwriting app then I would be in pure bliss. 🤗 I have to admin that I don't know RemNote or similar types of tools.  
My question here is how much RemNote needs web connection and ""intelligence"" from other places to organize/restructure information.

I think one of the main positive features of Supernote is that is focused on note taking, it can be used offline and you can choose when you need to go online or USB-connect to transfer/synchronise your stuff.  
To be too much dependent on external engines or tools (if this is something RemNOte requires) is not something I see as a positive path for Supernote, but of course this is a personal and quite limited point of view from myself :-) The poor CCO does not know much.

"Hi, I see with pleasure that Supernote is working hard to support editing functionalities for digital formats (i.e. Word .docx).

I have to admit that I'm not using them a lot now, but I'd like to ask here why the .docx format and if Supernote is planning to have a more general and standard approach to this.

Word is a proprietary tool and .docx is a not-so-great standard for text document (I don't use MSOffice and I use the standard .odt format, supported by LibreOffice, OpenOffice... for text documents).

What I'm thinking is whether simpler plain text formats could be supported as a more standard and interoperable basis to transform digital notes.  
I think that simple .txt files would be the first step, but an open and widely implemented and supported structured text format as Markdown ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)) would be an ideal solution.

I can see (dreaming) simple signs (short line or asterisks) for writing bullet points or identifying headers in the notes or ways to reference other notes (internal links). You already have some functions transforming manual input into structured commands (e.g. the square brackets or the stars for notes, the insert or flip command in the Word files) so it seems to me a natural evolution for more advanced functions.

I think that having a plain text format like Markdown supported could allow to have multiple types of export from it (.docx, .odt, .rst, simple .txt) and it can be well connected also with (future implementations of?) text recognition and transformation from manual notes to structured text.

Anyway, this is just food for thought... :-)

Ale I would personally love that feature! I do remember reading on this reddit that Mzrkdown support is planned. Text and MarkDown will be support. It’s in plan.

"Hi all,  what are the differences between the LAMY pen in the Superstar Set of the A5X and the Ivory White or the other styluses? For example, writing experience, weight, comfort. 

Thank you! Check out mydeepguide on YouTube. Has literally all the pen pro &amp; cons It's mostly a question of feel. I have 2 Heart of Metal (2nd with the ceramic nib) and a Lamy AL-star. The Lamy pen has a triangular shape on the part of the pen that you hold while writing. The Supernote pens are round, similar to a typical high-end ink pen. 

I find them both very comfortable to hold. The Lamy might be better for controlling the pen when trying to do precise work and it's lighter than the Heart of Metal. However, it probably comes down to personal preference. If you have access to a regular Lamy pen, the experience will be similar if you want to test it against a typical metal executive type pen that the Heart of Metal emulates.

The ceramic nib on the new Heart of Metal pens ensures that you won't have to worry about replacing nibs as they wear out. 

Personally, I like them both and alternate between them. The Lamy will also work on other EMR enabled screens like some Chromebooks and tablets. The ceramic nib on the Heart of Metal is hard so shouldn't be used with a device other than the supernote.

If you do a fair bit of drawing, then the Lamy might be the better pick. If you mostly take notes, I think that the Heart of Metal has the overall edge. I watched your guide and thought it was very good. I've watched many of your in-depth reviews and rely on them for choosing e-ink devices.

I would comment that I was surprised at the lower rating for Precision that you gave the Lamy (7/10) - not a bad rating - but in my experience, I found its precision to be very good and more comparable to the top of the group.

I was also surprised at the higher rating for the Samsung. It's a better pen than the standard Boox, but I didn't see it as anything special - too thin for my taste, round unlike the Staedler, and I didn't like the feel of the soft nib at all.

Otherwise, I agree with your ratings. 

Thanks for the guide! Thank you! You've been very helpful!",Difference between AL-star EMR and the other styluses,title prediction
"Hello all
I just figured out some of the basic yet powerful features needed on the the Supernote devices.

The pdf experience on the supernote is not bad, but some of  functionalities on it would make it great for any kind of document format...

1. Landscape mode for pdf documents.
2. Crop Features including the article mode support 
3. Gesture for bringing up the table of contents.
4. Insert clipart / image while taking notes.
5. Pinch to zoom in and out the content.

These features would make even the smaller A6x fully functional.

2. I will forward it to PM.
3. In kindle device, we can tap the top area to call the TOC. But in Supernote, we must filter the tap when writing. So can we call the TOC from sidebar?
4. In plan, but not start
5. Is developing. Awesome...
Thank you for the kind response
Really love the device and the writing feel on it
But yeah some times I feel adding functionalities would make the device even more better...

Looks like a lot of new features are on the map and really looking forward to see them on my A6X.

Reg.2 I mean TOC while reading pdf textbooks and not on the notes app.
And yeah if it is possible to call the TOC through the sidebar it would be handy and neat.
I have some ideas but not sure if it is possible to implement them on the device.
1. In a document -&gt; In the full screen mode (I mean *only when double tapped on a document to get rid of all the UI elements) - the sidebar when swiped up  instead of showing the regular app navigation menus it would be great if it shows TOC and as uasual manual refresh when swiped down. 
On exit (I mean again double tap) brings everything to the normal way as usual as it is at the moment...

Atleast an option to manually set what the swipe up side bar does in which TOC is an option.

"I really like how responsive and supportive the Supernote team is, especially on Reddit. It's great to see they consider the user experience and feedback. A little while ago someone posted something and a rep from the team made a comment like 'we hadn't thought of that, it's an interesting idea'. I think this type of feedback system is great!

However, I feel a lot of people post on this sub with a kind of 'all or nothing' slant - like if 'Supernote doesn't do X, then I'm not buying!' It""s fine, it's a forum, it's up to you to make your line in the sand somewhere. But, why are some people writing so absolutely? I think if we have feedback or suggestions, it would probably be most effective written with examples or justification or use-case scenarios. I know I'd be more inclined to listen to well-explained ideas rather than ultimatums. 

Alas, just some boxing day venting. Cheers y'all You should see r/remarkabletablet if you think this is bad... Not comparable.
Remarkable support does not respond, it is normal that ppl go absolute in that case. Supernote read every single line and answers.
The point is not ""it is bad"", the point is ""it has no sense to write with this tone."", as far as I understand. Yeah, in general I agree. A lot of people are kinda taking the teams responsiveness for granted.

Here are just a few examples:  

* ""I've put the same challenge to Goodnotes application team..."" ""My needs are simple""
* ""Mandatory functionalities needed""
* ""Why are you not supporting""

As much as I love the teams responsiveness, I do feel some people have been quite harsh in their wording when making requests.

Personally I'd rather the team improve what they already have, before adding more work to their plate and bloating the system. I've always seen Supernote to be a minimalist alternative to other devices simply for ""note-taking"".

I guess some people want stuff with all the bells &amp; whistles like:

* E-reader with pdfs, news, books, and probably even websites.
* E-writer with every single text format.

Which is pretty much the Onyx Boox. Which is not minimalist or lightweight. I'd personally rather a tool that does one job, and one job well. To jump off of the last sentence:

As useful as the kindle update is, I'm very excited for the improvements they're making with their native writing software (e.g. pencil brush and Word editing). They're consistently refining the ""mobile office"" idea with each update, and I'm glad to see that they take the time to put in additional stuff but only as secondary or supportive of the ""mobile office"" theme. Hopefully in the next update or the one after it, they have some improvements for the native pdf reader for markup and export.

"I had my A6x for a few months now, but today was the first time I had to transfer some files to it from my phone.  I tried to pair it, but I keep getting nowhere.  I tried initiating pairing from the phone and A6x with same results.

Basically the two devices see each other, both pop up a pin screen and both have a pair button.  When I click pair button on A6x a keyboard pops up, which I assume is to enter the pin.  When I enter the pin it kicks me back out of the bluetooth settings screen. The two appear to be briefly connected, but then connection is lost.  Any clue what's going on.

If it matters I have a Google Pixel 4 that works fine with my other bluetooth devices. We think that the Bluetooth transmission rate is low, so we did not use it to transfer files. And only use it to support Bluetooth keyboards and Bluetooth speakers. It will failed to connect to other devices. But we should give tips for other connections that are not supported. Clear information should be given instead of letting users guess what happened. This is our mistake. We will fix it as soon as possible.

If you transfer files from a mobile phone, it is recommended to use cloud synchronization. You can use Supernote Cloud or Dropbox. You can also use Wifi-Direct to transmit directly (it needs to be on the same WIFI network, sometimes it is not stable). Both of these methods require you to install the Supernote Parter App or Dropbox App on your phone. Is there any update on the super note app not functioning for the last few months?

1) How long does it take to ship? I live in California.

2) Is there a desktop app? If so, can I create a note in the desktop app or is it simply importing/exporting? The reason I ask is because my work prevents me from using cloud services due to security reasons. I was hoping I could import screenshots from my work computer and place it in a note on the A6X via USB.

3) How frequent are you guys recharging your device?

TIA!! Hello.

1. About the ship... It took me 7 days aprox to come to Spain. But I paid €150 of taxes...
2. Nope. Only the Browser version of supernote's app. But you can configure dropbox. The only problem is you cannot see notes in dropbox. You must export first to PDF or JPG from your A6X.
3. It depends, it can last 1 week if you use it for hours. For me is about 2 - 3 weeks of light use because I'm not that busy right now.

Anytime! 1) West Coast here. Bought it on Christmas, got shipped on the 28th, and received it on the 31st. So 3 or 6 days, depending on how you measure it.

"Hi! A very happy user of A6X here. I had a feature request. 

Currently the name of a new note is basically the timestamp without spaces. I do want dates as the name of the notes, but I would like the option to make it more readable so I don't have to change it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason and explanation:

* I find using the keyboard and renaming a notes doc every time I create one tedious, and the current timestamp one is not as readable
* Mostly I end up just adding spaces/dashes to make it more like yyyy-MM-dd-timstamp format, so would be great if say the device could give option what the default name is. 
   * Some options could be
      * yyyy-MM-dd &lt;day of week&gt; i.e. 2021-01-05 Tuesday
      * yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss i.e. 2021-01-05 12:00:00
      * yyyy MMM dd i.e. 2021 Jan 05
      * and many more
   * In case of duplicates, the notes can always append (count) to differentiate. Eg: ""2021-01-05 (1)"" if another file with the same name exists After seeing your suggestion, I immediately understood why I always thought the default file name was strange before.

"Hey... Just ordered A5X and have a few questions.

I have a sizeable Zotero library 6000+ pdfs that I currently sync to my BOOX via Google drive and an app (autosync). This works pretty well as Zotero automatically names the pdf files with author-year-title, and search is quick enough on BOOX to bring up the thing I need in a couple of seconds. I can then annotate and save, the annotated version gets automatically synced back to my laptop.

What I want to know is - does dropbox sync on Supernote automatically keep in sync? How well will Supernote handle that many PDFs in terms of search speed? And, will annotations be backed up straight to Dropbox/laptop?

Cheers! How are you using Zotero as a pdf library? :O Annotations are backed up to drop box as a separate .mark file. So you’ll have the original unedited .pdf, plus a .mark with annotations. 

You have to export or use the supernote companion app if you want new pdfs that have the annotations integrated. Zotero works really well to organise pdfs - you can drag/drop a pdf onto the main window and it will usually find the metadata for it (better than other reference managers I've used). The trick for getting pdfs easily available on mobile is to use the extension 'zotfile' which will rename the pdf and move it from Zotero's own labyrinth directory structure into one big directory that you can sync with Google Drive/Dropbox. Also, the browser addon for Zotero is great for taking html snapshots of webpages - these come out really well on Boox devices (I don't know about other ereaders) as text-resizable books.

The annoyance on Boox (as with Android tablets/phones) is there is no way to push changes to the Google drive folder to the device, so you have to use a third party app that you manually sync or set it to look at time intervals. This works, but just not very efficient.

There is an android app - zoo for zotero - that's really well made and can link to the synced folder to open pdf attachments. The problem is that when you have a lot of pdfs it can be very slow to open the pdf. Maybe down the line a version for Supernote could be great. Ah, thanks for the info. That should work fine for my needs. In some ways it is better to keep the version in my Zotero library clean from my scribbles anyway and it is good to have a separate place for marked up versions to know what's been read, maybe.","Zotero, Dropbox sync and search capabilities A5X",title prediction

an Idea I had, since kindle is its own aplication would be adding a small memo pad on the top pull down menu, that way taking quick notes from kindle (or any future apps might be possible) within the app. I dont know how feasible it is to make the app and note function work at the same time.

another thing I was thinking which I dont know if it is already a setting or not since I could not find it, is displaying the residence or contact info at the lock screen, in the case the tablet gets lost.

currently If I loose my device, whoever finds it would need to unlock it, go to the menu, find account information and then contact me.

Remember that these links will not crop your image so if there is ""blank"" space around your image, the image will not fill the screen. Ensure you crop them before using the links.

Should work for all Supernote devices as the specification page shows them all as having a resolution of 1872 x 1404.

"Hi Supernoters, I have a question.  

I am on the A5.  I have a note page that I use to document and track my billable hours for consulting services.  For ease of documentation of my consulting hours, I linked this page under [Quick access].  That note file now is now 37 pages long, and grows weekly.  Every time I go to [Quick access] and open this this note file, it opens by default to the first page.  I then have to jump to the last page to add new hours.  Is there a way to have Supernote to open (by default) the last page that was opened?  Has someone found a workaround?  If not, then can the last paged opened in a note page be the default when accessing a note file from [Quick access]?

Thanks Tats a neat idea. Could definitely see how that is useful. On drawboard there is a little symbol that lets you jump back to the start of the previous  'timestamp' like when you first started a chapter or something. It would be cool to have Great suggestion.

"Hello Supernote,

I’ve pre-ordered the 5x and am excited to start using it!  I’ve been watching videos on it and noticed you changed the ‘create’ button so that instead of instantly creating a new note, you now have to choose whether you want to add a note or a Word document. 

I think many of us will rarely (if ever) create a Word document as we have purchased this device primarily for making hand written notes. 

Can you please either move the Word document creation to another location, or only show that option after a long tap-and-hold, etc. so that a regular tap on the ‘plus’ icon will simply create a note?

I plan to create dozens of notes per day so this would make the experience much more pleasant. 

Thanks for considering. Agreed Your suggestion make sense. We will change it soon.

Thank you very much. Thanks very much! Agreed too!! I dont really need the word document creation function so readily. Perhaps place that option in the document folder? Thanks so much to the supernote team! I feel theyve been so innovative :)",Return to single-tap note creation,title prediction
"Hi everyone,

1.  I saw something posted here a while ago about choosing a server, but I can no longer find it.  I created my account on the Supernote A5x and enabled sync.  Upon logging into the cloud in my browser I accidentally clicked the China location, not realizing I couldnt switch afterwards.  Is there any way to switch server location after the fact?  Is there an option on the physical device I may not be seeing?

2.  I was testing things out, creating notes and playing around with the features.  I hit the sync button to upload what I have, went to the server website, and all I can see are the folders Ive created.  No notes show up at all, only the one screenshot I took.  Any information on this?

3.  Is there an export/save as pdf option yet?  I saw the post from a while back that it was coming but I havent seen any updates on it so far.

Thanks in advance for any help! Re. 1, paging /u/hex2asc.

For 2, have you actually selected the folders you want to sync? It doesn't default to syncing anything and might just be showing you a skeleton directory structure.

For 3, hit the 3 dots -&gt; Export -&gt; PDF, or do you mean proper vector export? For 2.  How do I select which folders to sync?  Long press, check them, then hit sync from the drop down?

3.  I figured that one out, just what I needed it to do.  Edited my original post.

Thank you for your help! So you need to go back into settings, go into sync, and click the right arrow to choose folders. You can choose a folder by checking it or enter the folder by tapping it (say you only want to sync a subdirectory -- as an example, I sync a directory called Personal but not Work).

If the folder chooser doesn't show up, it's a software glitch -- rebooting (in the settings too) will fix it. I see the arrow, and all of my folders are checked off",Questions about syncing and other things.,title prediction

"Hey, so I'm upgrading my trusty old kindle keyboard ereader and I really really like the look of the supernote devices. They just look much nicer than boox in my opinion. I love the aesthetic, the nicer pens, the nicer cases etc.

One of the huge reasons to upgrade my old kindle is to get a Glow light. At the moment I use a clip on light that is a faff. I know supernote devices currently don't have lights but will they in the future? Is it worth me waiting to see if they get one?

My second question is will super note support apps/apks so I can borrow books from my local library? Here in the UK most library's use BorrowBox which has an Android app. The second most popular library app is Libby. Will Supernote make these two apps available?

Thanks Very much doubt they'll ever have a light, it requires more space between the pen and the screen which makes writing feel funny. I think it's unlikely you'll see such niche apps supported but I don't know their full plans with regards to app support. It kinda seems like you're looking for a different device than what supernote is trying to be, the target is note taking as a top priority. Yeah fair enough, thanks for the feedback. I'm also an app developer and would love to make some eink friendly apps so I guess the boox or likebook devices are the ones for me. I just thought the supernote looked so much nicer! I saw an old comment of a user that suggested a folio with an integrated light. That would be a perfect solution in my opinion.
You have it if you want to, don't have it if you don't want. While waiting for mine to arrive I've been thinking about some of the things I'd like to see added (like Libby/Overdrive)... but I'm also thinking about how difficult the Ratta situation is.

"From what I have understood there is no charger shipped with the device.  
I wanted to ask the following  
a)Does the supernote support fast chargers  
b)What type of chargers does Ratta recommend for the supernote? I mean how many Amphere Here's a comment from hex2asc on A6X charge:
&gt; A6X support USBPD (the main fast charge standard). It's a negotiation protocol. When plugged, the charger will ask A6X, ""how much current you want?"", and A6X always answer,""1.5A is enough"". So the charger will start supply current limited by the agreement. You need not worry about too much current would damage the device. Typically A6X will get full charged in 2 hours by a 7.5W (or more powerful) PD charger.
&gt;
&gt; If you want to use a fast charger, please make sure it's PD type.
&gt; 
&gt; It's also ok if you use a computer USB port for charge, it will take more time than PD charger, at about 3-6 hours. Because of computer USB port usually limit the current supply at 0.5A-1A level.

"Hi,  


I have been deliberating between the Remarkable 2 and Supernote A6x for a while.

I was just about to order the A6x but I saw a lot of people having battery issues. The Remarkable lacks a lot of features against the A6x but the battery is way more superior, it seems.  This is disappointing since rm2 has a 3000 mAh battery vs A6x is smaller with a 2900 mAh battery.

  
However, there have been some latest software updates (one of the 12 days ago) on the A6x and the release notes contains some changes to battery performance. What is the exact status about battery issues right now? If battery is a big deal for me, should I go for rm2 instead? I own both . I cannot recommend the rm2 honestly . Get the a6x or the a5x , stylus is better , more accurate ( never have misalignment issues like I do on the rm2)( no expensive nib replacements ) . Supernote developers are doing fixes and implementing useful and important  features ( have already experienced a few myself ) , where as all the updates on rm2 have been trivial and haven’t really added to the ( already barebones) utility.  I use my a6x many times throughout the day I maybe charge it ever 2 days . The great thing is I charge it with a USB c charger and it charges very quickly , battery is of no concern here coming from someone who’s used it for more than a month now .  The biggest pain point with the rm2 is that you cannot simply plug it in and quickly drag and drop files . You have to use their apps and cloud and other silly workarounds . With the supernote it is just drag and drop , updates instantly . They have also mentioned fixes to help battery further . I recommend supernote Rm2 is also more expensive.

Charging once in two days is not so bad. But do you employ it for heavy use, like taking notes the entire day or something? Sometimes when I’m doing long drawing or long notes i charge every other day . When I’m just using it as a planner many days can go by . So, the weird battery bugs are probably fixed by now, but it still probably stands at somewhere like 6 hours of non-stop writing (from [MyDeepGuide](https://youtu.be/mB8fTVPH1cY?t=948)).

I personally think Supernote is superior simply because you don't need to pay multiple times for a new nib. Though Remarkable 2 and A6X are kind of a bad comparison since, A6X is much smaller. I've had the impression that both A5X and it's upcoming successor (intended to be released Q3 this year), will and are clearly much better than rM2.

Also from what I've heard, rM2 has terrible customer service.

Is it possible to transfer notes taken from remarkable 2 to the supernote a5x? I think only possible via PDF export. As far as I know the Supernote file system is unique &amp; different. Good question! I also have a rM2--ideally would be great to be able to continue a journal I started on rM2 over to SuperNote. Seems unlikely tho :( I did it by using PDF export.

"Just want to shout out that I got my first e-ink tablet - Supernote A5x! 

I've been thinking about getting one for more than a year, following the development of Sony and Remarkable, and after watching the review by Voja, decided to take a leap and got it.

Quite happy with the device so far, and am excited to find this community and that Supernote is actually seeking users' opinion here!

Happy writing! Agreed! Awesome device paired with amazing customer service and community! I just joined “the family” too, I love that everyone on here (including Ratta Supernote themselves) is so helpful! :) Me too - got mine yesterday and stayed up till 1am figuring out how to customise it and get my stuff on it.

"I got my A5X yesterday in the post and so far I am loving it!
I am having trouble syncing my Dropbox to the device though. I have connected to my account successfully, and Dropbox has registered that the supernote is connected. 
However when I go to select the folders I want to sync, it does not show my Dropbox folders, only the folders that are already on my device. I've tried rebooting/resetting like a previous post suggested but no luck. Am I missing a step somewhere?
Thanks in advance! I was playing with this last night, and discovered it would only sync folders that were put in the Supernote main folders. It looks like you can’t add folders to those main ones (which are documents, notes, mystyle etc.) To get the main supernote folders to sync you have to select them so they have a tick in the top left hand corner - then they appear in Dropbox) you can then move files into them.

"Morning Coach just posted a quick snapshot of 6 ways the Supernote A5X beats the reMarkable 2:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL3wJnqN2P0&amp;feature=youtu.be

I sent back the RM2 because it looked good but didn’t offer much functionality. Then I returned the Note Air had the opposite problem – bloated with apps and a complicated user interface that made work harder. 

Supernote A5X seems to solve both problems with refined apps built for purpose and a simple, streamlined interface to get things done without any headaches. I’d rather be working on a task than working out how to use the device. This video should be shown to everyone that loves remarkable 2 over other devices lol. Other than sketching, supernote can do everything remarkable can do, and BETTER Well... wait for his ""6 reasons to get Remarkable 2 over A5X"" video in a few days ;) Altho, as an owner of both, I am currently won over by the A5X (even tho I still really enjoy the ""feel"" of the rM2 device and writing when I pick it up and use it). The functionality of the A5X has won me over (love keywords), and not having to replace nibs! Since you have both devices, can you describe the writing experience of Supernote versus reMarkable? A lot of users have trouble describing writing on a Supernote. 

Also, which stylus do you have - the ceramic or the Lamy (I still have my Lamy which I loved using). Remarkable 2 has a ""scratchier"" free. Not in a bad way--in a good way. I guess the best analogy I've heard is: it feels like using a pencil on paper laying on a table or clipboard. It's feels like a harder surface, but again--not in a bad way. Frankly, I still feel like I might prefer it to the A5X feel--even tho the A5X feel is also very good. Yep, I know, maybe not the most helpful.

The A5X has a smoother/slicker feel... and it also depends upon which A5X pen you use. I have both the Heart of Metal and Lamy. The Lamy has a slight scratchier feel, because it's plastic. The HOM is very smooth (ceramic). In reality, the A5X and Remarkable are probably very similar in smoothness--but the Remarkable seems to have more friction/scratchiness due to the sound of its tip on its surface.

FWIW--even though I may enjoy the feel of the remarkable more, i like the sharpness of the A5X pens more. I feel like I can write cleaner/thinner lines on the A5X due to the different pen/surface (especially with the HOM).

As far as which A5X pen I prefer--I still don't know. When I switch to the Lamy, I think ""oohhhh yeah--I think this feels better"". But then I'll use that for awhile, and then switch back to the HOM, and think ""yep, I like the sharpness with this"". So, I guess--get them both if you can(!) I DO love the eraser button on the Lamy--extremely useful. And while I wish the design was a bit better (so I didnt have to find  and line up my finger with the erase button everytime I grab the Lamy), I still think the Lamy is great especially if you think you'll be erasing more than usual. The way I look at it--the Lamy is an eraser I bought that also has a built-in pen ;) And the HOM is for when I just want sharp lines and I'm not worried about making mistakes and/or needing to use the eraser much. The UI's erase function still works well with either one, so not a big deal--but the Lamy's eraser button is very convenient once you have it and get used to it.",Morning Coach lists 6 reasons why Supernote A5X beats reMarkable 2,title prediction
"Dull - but necessary question.  I'd like to use my supernote for both personal purposes and work and therefore do have some questions about how my data is used. There are quite a few users in here from Europe (where GDPR or UK GDPR is applicable).  I had a look at your privacy policy and note that it says that it's only applicable for mainland China.  There is also a statement which says, ""In principle, the personal information we collect and generate in China will be stored in China"" [https://supernote.com.cn/user/PrivacyPolicyEn.html](https://supernote.com.cn/user/PrivacyPolicyEn.html) However you will be processing data which is generated elsewhere and stored in your servers either in China or Amazon Japan.   Please can someone provide more transparency about what happens with our data.  It's worth looking at RM's privacy policy as it does at least contain more specific info about what happens to our data. I usually don t care about this stuff, my data being anyway sold in every part of the globe, but tag me when someone replies, because now I am curious as well. Well... if you're using this as a digital notebook, you're likely storing more than just basic identity info such as email or phone number (the typical data sold around the world). People may choose to store very sensitive information in their notes... if the data is not protected, that data could be exposed. Which is why I'm very leery of putting any sensitive data in my A5X until I have the ability to store in a different service such as Google Drive. Even then, I'm still not fully trusting enough to put sensitive data in this device :( Thank you for bringing this up - it's something very reasonable to ask. I have the same problem as you because I want to use these devices for work and some of the things I write or draw could eventually become IP. If the data gets in the wrong hands, it's pretty well known some Chinese companies can steal and not care about IP ownership laws.
I'm really encouraged by Ratta's responses on this subreddit so would be great to hear from them on this. This is very important!

There are two types of data that will transfer to the server

The first is cloud services

In order to comply with Chinese laws (all companies providing information services in China must set up servers in China. Apple is no exception). But this doen't matter with users outside of China. What we said,  ""In principle, the personal information we collect and generate in China will be stored in China"" is mainly for chinese users. Don't worry about that.

If you want to use Supernote cloud service, we strongly recommend  do not use a Chinese server. (Amazon Japanese server is now available, US server/EU server is coming soon). Otherwise, you can use Dropbox instead. I don’t need to confirm if you are not a Chinese user, because Chinese users cannot see this message (Reddit is blocked in China).

Anyway. The most thorough method, you can turn off the cloud service. Use USB data cable, U disk and other methods to transfer data with computer.

The second is the User Experience Project.

If you agree to participate in the User Experience Project, we will upload some logs. It is usually the performance info in some operation events, such as the time it takes to open the file, the data of battery consumption, and the related information when the fault occurs. We use these data to evaluate and improve performance. It will not be used for purposes not related to improving performance. We will list log types and uses in detail later and update on the website. You are right, We need transparency.

If we need more detailed information for special purposes, such as improving the rendering of handwriting. We will launch a special volunteer program, where participants can send samples of their non-privacy note files to our collection mailbox. We will not store such data in the log.

Anyway, you can refuse to participate in the User Experience Project to avoid uploading any information.

I want to say that your concerns are absolutely necessary.

I.e. when exporting a note as a pdf, it would be great if I could have supernote insert a margin around the note. 

This would be useful if one wished make notes on the exported note using something like Skim on the computer. It would also be useful if the notes are to be submitted to a marker, as the marker would have more space to write comments.

"Just wondering about a possible implementation of a way to rapidly switch between two apps - like ALT-TAB on a computer. At the moment if I want to switch between a note and a book I have to swipe the side bar, then tap on the thing I want. This is pretty good. 

But I just wonder if there could be an option in settings to remap an up-swipe from screen refresh to app-switch. This would make an make it a really quick way to move between two things. 

If this option was selected, the screen refresh function could be activated by an on-screen button in the toolbar. Similarly, if the user chose to keep swipe up to refresh, then the toolbar button could active the app switch.

Just a thought! Interested to hear what others think. I do also really like swipe up to refresh, but for me personally I think I would get more use from switching apps.

Also, the ability to wake the device with a swipe (up or down) would be a nice touch - I find myself trying to do this anyway! :) I think clicking the button to wake to sleep is enough for me, even on my Boox it’s the same thing.

As for the swipe up to switch apps, I like it how it is now (swipe up to refresh), I actually have the same gesture on my Boox. Given that the limited number of apps is visible on swipe down anyway, I find that enough to switch between apps/documents really quickly. I would like this as an option, too. Perhaps it could be an option for the swipe up, to change in settings? Much like the first iPad allowed the switch to be either screen lock or something else (was it mute?), depending on user preference. I hardly use the swipe up. I think it would be awesome to customize and have users choose what they want that action to be. Personally I would like it to open the last most recent note or file so I can quickly switch between two. This would be a neat addition.",Swipe up for rapid app switching (and wake from sleep),title prediction

"I have 6 custom templates... they appear in the device's MyStyle folder, but only 4 of the 6 appear in the Template-&gt;Customization selection screen. Also, there are 2 templates I initially added but then deleted. Everything looks fine on the SuperNote (Japanese) cloud server/website, as well. It's just the the template-&gt;Customization screen that is messed up (only shows some of the custom PNGs I added, and 2 that I deleted are still there).

Yes, I have rebooted--a couple times, and I have sync'd a few times. I also made sure the MyStyle folder was checkmarked in the sync settings.

I now get 4 of the 6 templates in my Customization template pages, and the deleted ones are gone. So now, I'm missing 2 of the 6. Is there a reason it will only show the first row of 4 in there? A common issue is the use of special characters in filenames as you have already discovered by removing periods from your filenames. Although the Supernote manuals list various characters to avoid they fail to include underscores in their list ( \_ ) which is often the culprit for custom templates not showing up. No underscores. The files that appear in the Customization page have the same format as those not appearing. Only use letters, numbers and spaces in the fielnames.

"Hey guys, just discovered e-ink devices recently and been doing some research. Even though i love the idea behind it, and am very intrigued to get one, I'm still between the fences about whether i really need one. 

Therefore, I'd like to find out what you guys are really using it for and what made you buy one. After all they aren't cheap devices and i wanna make sure I'm not wasting money. I use it as a daily planner , brain dump, sketch book , notebook all in one place. Helps me to organise my thoughts and notes beyond what I could with a regular notebook. Plus I just much prefer handwriting then typing on computer in meetings etc, I can concentrate better and also be more free in structure which helps me. Finally, the A5X is just so nice to write on that I now actually write more and I’m less precious about pages too! I should add that I also love that it’s not a tablet per say, so less distractions, blue light and need to recharge often. Not to mention no glass! I also own iPad Pro with pencil, and i love using the ipad with pencil mainly for marking up pdfs and notes. I also use it for board games (i'm a big boardgamer), in which I'll track game status/characters/etc by using PDF game sheets in Notability (ipad note taking app), and marking 'em up. BUT... I got intrigued by e-ink note takers for the better non-glass feel and to get away from staring into a computer/lit display. With that said... I'm fairly new with a rM2 and A5X. The software is generations behind iPad... but the e-ink/non-glass experience makes it worth if. Will I be solely e-ink and no iPad for note taking? Not sure. But right now, ive been 100% A5X (after starting with rM2) for about 4 weeks. Also using it for tracking workouts (I maintain a daily workout journal), general daily notes... and the keyword feature on the A5X has won me over, as it allows my to label/tag journal spots for easy searching. Software is quirky/buggy (e.g. the cloud sync functionality), but I'm hopeful (based upon Ratta's strong customer involvement/dialog) these will be ironed out and improved. Before I ve bought the A6X, I wanted to write, but the thought that pages end filled me with dread, so I didn t write. It s a poor excuse, because I do not write even after I acquired an infinite amounf of digital pages.

If I had the money, I would have definitely gone with the iPad Pro, but I am glad I didn t. 

An e-ink tablet is the perfect substitute for a notepad and that s all it is to it.

What sold it to me was the infinite pen and the community that they ve build on reddit, the last being the most important. Now, thinking about it, whatever they would sell, I would buy.

Hi u/Hex2asc,

I’ve had my A5X a few days and I think it’s fantastic. Here is some initial feedback, requests and questions:

&amp;#x200B;

**Feature requests**

* Please can we have caps lock on the keyboard
* Please can we have a way to add accents to letters in the keyboard
* There should be the ability to change the date format (eg dd/mm/yy) from the default American format of month-day
* Should be able to send PNG attachments in email. Currently, sending attachments only works with PDF, while PNG attachments are ignored
* Please can we have indented lists in Word when using bullets?

**Questions**

* In word, is there some way to erase a handwritten mark or writing?   
If I make a mistake while adding handwritten text or marking up, there seems to be no way to delete it, other than double-tapping to convert it and then deleting it after conversion, which is really laborious. It would be great to have an eraser button.

**Other feedback/bugs**

* When switching from handwriting to typing in Word or when turning on repage view, any hand writing on the page is deleted without any warning or asking to convert it first. This is a serious issue and can cause a lot of lost work.
* Backspace connect does not work as described in the manual 
* You can't rename a Word doc when it’s open the way you can with a note. This feels inconsistent
* When renaming a doc or note from the files overview, the 'x' is too far to the right (this does not affect the function, it’s just is an aesthetic UI bug)
* Deleting a document in the cloud from the browser interface does not work. You get a confirmation, but the file stays in the folder, even after sync. The only way to delete it is from the A5X device itself, which then works across the device and the cloud after syncing.

Thank you in advance for your consideration and keep up the great work! Just a quick feedback on ""Please can we have caps lock on the keyboard"".

I can simply double click the ""Shift"" (big up arrow) key. I agree for the date, it is really confusing, it should adjust based on the timezone or let us define the way we want to appear ""Deleting a document in the cloud from the browser interface does not  work.

Awesome! Somehow none of the  reviews I have watched mention the hyperlink support. And I had a very very negative experience with the Remarkable's software making me cautious purchasing cool looking but expensive products.

Is the table of contents collapsible and respecting the hierarchy? I.e. is it easy to navigate a book with four chapters but hundreds of paragraphs in the TOC? Or everything is on the same level (making it difficult to find the chapters)? If the latter, is it on the timeline to fix it?

And is there an option to search for PDF metadata? I plan to have many pdfs on the device and I would like to search for authors/title/arxiv number (if the title is long, then it's not practical to use it as a file name) etc. This fantastic mate.

"All of the other e-ink devices are available on either Android or Linux platforms. Supernote is the only device that gives you a choice because its tablets are available with either operating system. Amazing.

I’d like to know what users see as the pros and the cons of both platforms. Do Supernote’s Linux products have a faster processing speed or better latency? Do the Android devices offer better functionality? 

Why do you think one is better than the other, based on your use case? I’d love to know what Ratta thinks as well and why they are committed to producing two versions of the A6 and A5. I went with the A5X because although I don't use Kindle it seems like the Android OS has more potential for additional functionality in future. It's been working great so far - it does slow down a lot when I'm drawing and using the copy/paste and resizing features heavily but honestly I don't really mind that as drawing really isn't the primary reason I got it. I also can't comment on whether the A5 is any better in this respect - maybe someone else could add something here?

I saw it said somewhere that although the battery capacity is greater on the A5X the android OS is more demanding and so the battery life is actually lower - again I don't have a point of comparison but I certainly haven't had any issues with battery life, keeps going for multiple days.

"I preordered the A6X and I've really enjoyed it as my first ereader and note taking device. However, there are basic navigation features that would make it much easier to use.

It's annoying to flip through tens of pages when navigating through documents and digests. There should be an an option to skip multiple pages, skip to the end, and enter a page number (similar to when navigating documents). Even better would be searching for files or folders in the current directory or skipping by alphabetic ordering (skip to where Hs or Vs begin like a contact book).

It would be nice to have a back button when navigating documents. So when I open a folder, I can go back to the same page in the document navigator rather than flipping through all the pages to get back to the same page.

Most if not all good epub readers automatically embed links to footnotes, so you don't need to flip to the references pages to find the footnote. It'd be really nice if I could tap on a footnote and have the footnote appear in a little window.

One should be able to annotate digests in the document viewer, rather than navigating to the digests app.

Each of these features would improve the ease of use a lot for me. In addition, having a overview that shows a grid of all pages like the remarkable would make it much easier to navigate visually when you don’t already know which page number you want You are in luck!! All of these options are available on your device already! Taping the ellipse in the toolbar brings up the menu which the overview option which brings up page thumbnails. u/official_marcoms. Taping on the page numbers opens up the ability to jump to any page you would like. Dragging down from the top of the screen allows you to search all directories by file name, keywords or stared pages. I highly recommend running through the user manual there are a lot of hidden tools and gestures built into different parts of the device and Ratta is always listening to its users for more feedback! I think I wasn't clear on the page skipping. I don't mean the pages in a document, I mean the pages when browsing through files and folders. It would be great if the same functionality to skip to a page in a document also worked when browsing a folder of documents. I sometimes reverse the sorting so I can at least flip through each page in the list of documents from the reverse of the alphabetic order.

I like the search function, this is ends up being the best way to go. Searching in the current directory is what I usually want, but this isn't so important.

I realized the last feature is in the user manual. I was tapping digests with the stylus, but I figured out that I need to tap it with my finger to annotate a digest.",Feature Request: Navigation and Usability,title prediction

"Random notes from today's waste management class on Vermicomposting. I really like taking notes by hand I find that I remember more of the content when I draw and doolie the ideas out. This is one of the many reasons I really enjoy my supernote. It has become part of my study pattern to go back, edit and clean up the doolies a bit. After class, I will take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour adding to the notes and doodles. The post by u/teicherus of the [possible colors values](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/lmo94r/possible_color_values_for_templates/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) on the SN have me excited about the potential of the current hard wear and to see what other tools are to come! 

Additionally, I enjoyed the use of the floating toolbar, however, I wish I could turn it horizontal again.  I used to keep it docked to left hands side of notes and it was rarely in my way (right-handed). I very much like the ability to collapse it and move it freely but if I could have the choice, either in the settings or on the toolbar, to select horizontal or vertical position when free that would be awesome. Seems like it might be an easy addition?

One other thing I really love is the title page, its use for building a table of contents is perfect functionality! However, I don't like the hash marks. I would like to still be able to differentiate the title without effectively crossing them out.  Is there currently a way to disable that or a workaround anyone has found? For future updates, I personally would rather brackets around the title much like the diegest. Or even a box but the hash marks kinda kill it for me.

The only thing I miss about taking notes on paper is that I used a lot of color-coding and go back through and watercolor them. One day a super note with a color E-ink screen,... now that would be pretty sweet..

I'm trying to figure out how to get a pen that is heavier overall because I'm finding I don't press hard enough to get that feeling of resistance anymore.

You covered all of the features and attributes of the three pens extensively, including the writing experiences. Just what I needed to know. These styluses are another reason to love Supernote.

Just one thing I’m curious about — spoiler alert — I assume the HOM pen is also your favourite for drawing, but what about marking up documents where you’d use a stylus to highlight text rather than write? ... Would Lamy’s “gliding over the paper” be better here than HOM’s “digging into the paper” sensation?

Whatever the case, it’s good to see one manufacturer offering high quality pens (plural) that deliver different benefits to different users. I don't own the basic pen, only the Lamy and the HOM, but I agree with you even if my opinion isn't perhaps as strong!

Now I own the Max Lumi, too, but my go-to is still the Supernote for the calendar, general note-making and the reading smaller page-sized PDFs. I just love the feel of the screen with the HOM! The digest annotation feauture, the sharpness of the screen rendering, the ability to star your faviourites, the way you can organise a notebook, the support team, etc., make this one of the best purchases I have made in a long time, and your videos were key to that, so thanks!

"I've been on and off the last few months waiting to get the RM2, until I discovered SuperNote, and I have a few questions.

1) The A5x and A6x are basically the same exact thing, except for the size of the device? I read elsewhere on the reddit that palm-rejection is missing on the smaller one too, but it's on the road map?

&amp;#x200B;

2) As someone who will use the device for taking various notes, how much of a deal breaker is the size of the A6x vs the A5x in your opinion? I may do some lite kindle reading, but I highly doubt it.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Any general reviews, tips, tricks, etc are welcome. I haven't seen much on here, but I've spent time watching videos from CPO, MyDeepGuide, GoodeReader, and a few other channels. 1. They run the exact same firmware, so functionally yes. The screen of the smaller one/A6X is glass and the larger one/A5X is... not-glass (plastic?)... but same film on the screen. The smaller one has higher ppi. The A6X actually does have palm rejection (I use it!) I think I’ve read here the A5X that doesn’t have it yet but I’m not sure. 

2. For note taking, I would base it on your preferred size of paper notebook. I literally tried measuring it out before I bought one to get a feel for the size haha. A6X screen is basically the size of an iPad mini screen. I think it’s a great size because it’s about the size of the notebooks it replaced for me (Moleskine Large)  but it’s really dependent on what you are comfortable with. 

3. [I did a short sort-of-review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/l7rgn5/a6x_initial_reviewfirst_impressions_latency_etc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) when I got my A6X, with some photo comparisons etc. which might help you decide! I'll make sure to check out the review (I started to earlier, but got sidetracked watching some videos on the devices).

&amp;#x200B;

To try and put size into perspective, if it's a standard college-ruled notebook (or maybe a 1-inch binder) how do the devices compare? 2. Keep in mind that the A6 writing area is small. 4 and 5/8 inch by 6 and 1/8 inch. The external size of the A6X is about the size of an A5 notebook. So if you are used a Moleskine or Leuchtturm1917, you'll want to go with the A5X even though the external size of the A5X is bigger than those notebooks. 

3. If you write small like me, you may go with the 0.2 nib size. But on the A5X, the lines look a bit jagged. Ratta is working on this issue. On the A6X, the higher resolution means I find it more comfortable to write in my usual handwriting size without the cognitive dissonance of the jagged lines. But I like having the physical screen real estate of the A5X. One thing that helped me with the nib size issue is to use a finer point stylus. Those are definitely closer to A5X.

The photos in the post I linked show the A6X, open, next to Rhodia and Moleskine notebooks and a Kindle Paperwhite for reference. I don’t share the experience of the poster below at finding it small (you’ll see in the photo the screen width is about the same as a page on a Moleskine), but you sound like you’re used to much larger paper notebooks so I would skew larger!",Opinions,title prediction
"I have a 6X. When I set it down on a metal cart near my work station it goes to sleep so I could not see my notes. I was getting frustrated thinking maybe that was an intended function to save battery or something. Just realized it only happens on the metal cart. When I set it down on another surface it stay on. Maybe an interaction with the magnet that is used to trigger sleep/wake? Hi u/betterwithchem, I have the same issue on a metal Ikea balcony table. The whole A5X actually feels to stick to the table slightly when the cover flap is folded underneath. Try leaving the cover open like a normal book, instead of folding over and underneath the device. I have better results like that usually... That is definetly the sleep function the supernote has for its folio. When ever the folio closes the supernote will go to sleep and when opened it will wake up the supernote. This is done with magnets. Since the table is metal the supernote's think it's the folio in its closed position and it goes to sleep, try placing something like a book or a cardboard between the supernote and the surface to avoid that problem. Maybe even consider using a stand. /u/hex2asc Is there a way we can get a switch in the settings to disable close-to-sleep?

"I use my A5X to take notes primarily, but thinking of trying the RM2 because I have been less than impressed with battery life? Any thoughts? I have the A6X and RM2 and honestly prefer the A6X.  The RM2 seems bulky even though it isn't really.  I like how the a6x feels to write on (though I hate the new movable menu.  HATE), and the RM2 does not feel like paper.  The menus seem more difficult to navigate, though I probably just need more practice.  If yoyve already got the a5x id just stick with that. &gt;already got the a5x id just stick with that.

My thought as well. Battery life on the rM2 is great when the device is idling (not in use) when in use it's not that great, but more than enough. You might get better battery life with the rM2 (don't have both, can't compare) but the difference won't be that big, and the rM2 is more fragile (glass based screen, some people have problem with the little button because it's in a zone that easy to shock, etc.). If you have a SN and it suits your need, no need to bother with the rM2 IMO, unless battery life when idling is your main criteria. Yes, I have both, and I have to say, it's a really tough call between them, but at the moment, I'm leaning more to the A5X.

Points in the RM2's favor:
* Significantly longer battery life
* Best writing feel (in my opinion)
* Calligraphy pen (I love it!)
* Thumbnails show writing on PDFs (this is important to me because I edit a lot of PDFs and it's easier to keep track of what document I've worked on)

Points in the A5X's favor:
* Ceramic nib, no more replacing plastic nibs
* Continued platform development (calligraphy pen coming soon, along with many other developments)
* Wakes up when folio is opened

The ceramic nib is what tips my preference for the A5X: I hate the idea of having to replace nibs every two weeks to a month (depending on how much writing I'm doing) and gives me the mental freedom to write and write without thinking about how I'm wearing down the nib, or ordering new ones, and so on. The fact that Ratta is so responsive to users also stands in stark contrast with Remarkable's radio silence. I know that the Supernote platform will continue to improve, so I'm willing to wait for things like a calligraphy pen. (And they are also working on battery life -- it's never going to reach the same level as RM2's, but I wouldn't be surprised if they managed to get another day out of the existing design.)

If what you're looking for is for someone to assuage your concerns that you may have made a wrong decision, here it is: stick with the A5X, the Remarkable is not significantly better to justify forking over a ton of money for similar functionality. Yes, the battery life is better, and I love the feel, but unless the A5X's battery life is causing you major headaches, stick with what you've got.",Does anyone have Remarkable 2 and Supernote A5X?,title prediction

"I recently returned a reMarkable 2 and replaced it with the A5x. Overall I'm happy with the switch, but there are two features I REALLY miss:

1. The send to reMarkable Chrome plugin which allowed me to send pretty much any article I found online to my reMarkable as a PDF. Amazing! Any chance Ratta could offer something like that?
2. The ability to simply flip the stylus around and use the other end as an eraser. It is so much easier and more natural. And yes, I have the Lamy pen but don't use it at all because my finger often accidentally pushes the erase button. If you print from you desktop and save to your Dropbox folder (if you sync that way) it is just as quick in my experience. 

But I also am on a Mac and don’t like chrome. So I am not the most objective. 

On my iPhone I use the Instaweb browser and it prints to an a5 pdf format which i save to my Dropbox folder and it is quicker and more reliable than the remarkable app in my experience. 

I am supportive of the idea of a chrome plugin. But I think the syncing options on supernote make it unneeded Thank you for your feedbacks. I think something will be change. I haven't found the dropbox synching to be that easy to set up. And it's hard to imagine anything easier than being on a site like The Atlantic, going to the top right of the browser and clicking the button that says ""send to reMarkable"" and having it instantly appear on your tablet.

"Wondering if anyone else lately is noticing issues with the screen? I've had my A6X for about 6 - 8 months, but the last probably month or so am noticing some issues (Tried looking for similar problems but didn't see any, if I've missed this issue posted somewhere else please let me know!)

*Processing video 0vi6y64bq9q61...*

1. Not recognising touch. I've attached a video from this morning. It's not all the time, but happening probably every 2nd day now, it randomly won't recognise touch input - only pen; or vice versa. Restarting does work, but I often have to restart 2 or 3 times for it to work, and sometimes it won't restart (it just sits there refusing to accept either input). 
2. The bottom half of the screen seems to be not always responding properly to pen input. Having trouble filming this, as I notice it mostly during lectures when I'm writing a LOT in a short amount of time, and am willing to accept that it could well be me writing in a hurry and causing the issue. Occasionally when I write, the words/strokes are half missing, like a pen running out of ink. And on the right-hand size, about 1/3rd of the way down, there's a weird ""blip"" section where if I draw a straight line, it instead sometimes curves outwards (again, hard to film, it doesn't seem to do it when I want to hahaha) or if I write on lined templates near there it won't write in that spot, instead bunching the letters up behind it as if I were trying to write off the edge.

I haven't dropped, damaged, banged, spilled anything on, sat near or on a magnetic device, or in any other way I can think of caused any damages to the device, I study from home and it lives on my desk 95% of the time. Any thoughts? I'll try to get a video of the ""low ink"" issue asap. Hopefully this is just a simple thing fixed in the next update :) I have similar issues but mine do not seem as prevalent as yours. At times my A5X will not recognize a finger touch until I use the stylus first. But after I use the stylus once it usually goes back to normal. Yeah, it used to do that rarely, but this has become much more pronounced, and the only fix I can find so far is a restart (or three hahaha). It's not happening often enough to really be a huge problem or anything, but the increase has me a bit worried. And the words not writing properly at the bottom are a bit concerning too, but I'm still not sure if that's just how I'm writing, or a genuine issue. Hey mate, are you still experiencing this issue or did Rata sort it out yet? I've been looking to get one of these devices but have seen this complaint pop up a couple times and am just wondering if its an ongoing thing. I was, and ended up emailing about it, and they replaced the device. I am having some possible issues with the new one, but not sure yet if that's just me (different problem). Regardless, I absolutely love mine, even if there are a few bugs or problems. I think pretty much every company will have issues like this, but the stand-out thing for me is their customer service and support. Even with the issues, they've been fantastic at talking it out and trying to sort out the issues; plus they listen to us as customers when we suggest changes or things we'd like to see.",Screen Issues,title prediction
"I have a couple of custom Note templates I use for meetings. One has a Title/Attendee/Follow Up area at the top that I use as the first page of notes for any meeting, and then when I continue taking notes on the next page, I change to the 8mm rule stock template. Then the next time I have a new meeting for the same client or project, I switch back to my custom template for that first new meeting note page.  


So, my request(s):

&amp;#x200B;

* Can we have an option to sort templates with custom ones first when we go to template selection? That would put my three custom ones first, and then the 8mm ruled one would be immediately following, and I would not need to go to the next page of templates every single time a new meeting comes up.
* In the alternative, give us the ability to rename templates so we can then sort them in any order by name.
* This third is a long shot. Can we specify how many pages a template will be used when selected, and then the one to follow it? So, I can have my custom template selected, and when I go to the next page, it will automatically shift to the ruled template I select as the second page of any meeting. Then I'll only need to select my own template for the first page of a meeting, and not need to select any other. This should override the system default for the Note template.

Thanks! I was thinking last night how much easier it'd be to be able to sort the templates, just hold to rearrange so the most-used are first in the list or something. Most used or last used would work very well for my use case. I just hate to go to the second page of templates for no good reason almost every time I have a meeting. Agreed, I use mine mainly for study and have made up some templates for definitions or equations and some summary sheets for lectures or chapter notes, and having to keep scrolling through them all to set those up for each lecture is not quite ""annoying"" as such, but it would be simplified with the option to arrange how I'd like. It's not a hugely inconvenient thing, but I was uploading more last night and starting to realise just how many I have now, and thinking that it's going to become a bit harder to find what I want (I am a self-confessed digital-hoarder and can absolutely guarantee I'll end up with way more templates than I need or use regularly hahaha) Most used or let the user rearrange the order to their own accord.",Feature Request - Template Sort Order,title prediction

"First, I’d like to thank this forum, as it has been key for my decision to buy this fantastic device. I reserved a Remarkable last summer and changed my mind after being surprised on how responsive the Supernote community was.

I’ve used the A5X for more than 2 months now and I absolutely love it. I’m not the artist-type of user and my goal was to use it as a replacement of my work paper-based notebooks. I have to say the A5X nails it for this purpose.

However, there’s always gap for improvement and I’d like to request some improvements that will make my life easier.

1) Move pages to other notes. Believe this was already requested. To me this is a key feature as the copy-paste is not always working as expected.
2) Improvements in copy-paste. It happened to me a couple of times that I paste something on the wrong place and didn’t find the way to redo the paste. It looks like the clipboard is emptied after the paste so, if you undo it, you lose the copied data. This made me lose some selections and makes me now be very careful with the copy-paste.
3) Digest without comments. I think the digest feature has a lot of potential. I use it intensively as a marker without adding comments. When retrieving the digest I see lots of blank spaces and even an option to remove the “marked” text and keep only the comments. I’d love to have it the other way around. A version without comments, so that I can get a summarized version of the book based on the marked text.
4) Improved sensitivity on the toolbar. Not sure of this but I recently got the feeling that, since I upgraded to one of the latest versions, I need to press harder to make a selection on the toolbar (e.g. switch between the pen and the rubber). This is also a bit annoying as sometimes I have to try 2 or 3 times before getting the correct tool. I believe there has to be a way to increase its sensitivity so that’s easier to select.

I hope my comments help to improve this already-amazing device. Thanks for your feedback and great suggestions! Thanks for your sincere feedback and suggestions. Yes,  the function of moving pages to other notes , which is one of the most important features that will be available in the future, each page is independent which should be moved between different notebook freely , that is similar to a binder.   Additionally,  ""a version without comments in digest"" and ""improving the sensitivity on the toolbar"" will all been submitted  to the IT team for further optimization.   Best Regards Thanks for your quick response as usual.

I have two more requests, I've just realized:

1) Be able to remove ""Star Mark"" from the search. When I search for star marks, it finds  stars that are not viewable in the note. What I mean is that I open the note and I cannot find the start mark. I believe maybe a dot or something very small is detected as a star. As I cannot delete it from the note, I believe the best would be to be able to delete it from the search page (e.g. long press to have the option to delete)

2) Select button on the ""compressed"" floating toolbar. The compressed toolbar is a great idea but I miss the selection button, which forces me to extend it. I think it would be great to have it there together with the pen, rubber, do and undo buttons.",A5X feedback after 2 months,title prediction

"Hi Everyone,

I know these kinds of questions have been asked a lot already, but I would still prefer some feedback on my specific use-case. First things first, I am planning on buying a reader and am deciding between the A5x and the Boox Note Air. I want to use the tablet to read academic journal articles while sitting outside in the sun. Now, most of what I will be doing is just reading, though I will generally do some note-scribbling at the side of pages as well. It sounds as if the Lumi Max would be my ideal option, mainly due to its size, but I don't really want to spend $900 on this so I'm stuck between the A5x and the Note Air. Voya, and others, seem to suggest that the Note Air has a slightly better/faster reader, which, I think, would be very important for me. On the other hand, It's a bit more expensive since you have to get an extra pen and, from my understanding, does not have the same Dropbox support that the Supernote has.

Has anybody tackled the question from a similar standpoint? Would really appreciate some more thoughts.

Thanks I have owned the Lumi and the A5X and prefer the A5X because the screen is more crisp (less layers between base panel and your eyes), the pen is better, the annotation features are smart (digest and stars), it feels more durable and notebook-like, and the company is very receptive to feedback. However, Boox devices are very, very fast. Much faster than the Supernote, although I don’t mind the occasional 1-2 second delay in between gestures etc. because I love what the device stands for. The PDF reflow/crop/landscape mode features on the Boox are more advanced than what the Supernote has currently. The Boox Max Lumi and Note Air don’t feel like very well thought out devices, but their capabilities are very powerful if you know what you are doing in the Android ecosystem. 

Tl;Dr: I owned a Lumi and sold it because the text wasn’t very crisp (too many layers on the screen) and the pen sucked. The A5X is a quality, purpose built device with a perfect pen for notetaking and annotating simpler, one-column a4 PDFs but anything more complex and you will meet its limitations very quick. Some thoughts: the Boox Note Air is based on a Carta screen, it has a thin layer of glass and can break quite easily. The A5X (or Note 3) might be more durable.

A5X is more on a minimalist approach even though it's android based. 

I'd say that there is more chances that you get long term support on the A5X, Onyx tends to release new devices and to forget about older ones, that receive no software updates when new models are released. Hard to tell how Ratta will be on the long run on that front, but from what we can read, them seem to be planning to provide upgrades for longer than Onyx.",A5X vs Note Air for PDF annotating,title prediction

Just wondering how it would holdup when the tip would fall on a hard flour i.e. hardwood or paving stone when in garden. I guess time will tell.

I was torn between 6X and 5X. Mobility versus writing space. I intend to transition from A5 paper notebook BJ, of which I started the 7th now, to the SN. Have scanned in the paper BJ's converted to PDF which I intent to import to SN and create a grant index page. Planning to use/utilise/create a template for daily sheet that has some pre-set goal trackers / quotes or at least space for them that should stay on the page  for a whole month or even year as a reminder and without having to flick pages. So space would be already taken up by that and in that respect the A5x made more sense. A5x also allows more flexibility when going to draw concepts/mindmaps/process diagrams etc.

Also looking forward to using this as a learning driver. For example if one wants to learn all chemical elements you could use one layer to show an empty periodic table and then try to fill out all elements and their properties from memory on another layer and the repeat by deleting the 2nd layer without having to re-draw or print out the table structure and all that without  a paper mess and no need for a printer. I have/tried the Galaxy Tab S7 pen, the Staedtler Noris Jumbo, the HoM, and the standard Sn pen.  The HoM is fine, but the one I use most is the standard pen it came with.  I'm still eying the LAMY, for the eraser button.  But It's hard to justify spending another $60-70USD for a 4th pen (I returned the Jumbo).  

I prefer not having to replace nibs.  I do have the same question about ""impact durability"" though.  Thankfully I haven't yet had to find out.  

I really was using a daily planner template with a Tasks, Meetings-at-a-glance, Quick Notes, and Scratchpad page for every day of the year.  I've fallen out of the habit lately though and pretty much have only been using it for meeting notes.  I like your learning driver method. I also just ordered.

"Hi, everyone! I'm wondering about your experience using the proofreading tools on the Supernote.

If so - why start with a Pentagram? Am I able to turn it off in this version? I'd love a auto-draw feature like procreate has. This would make the Supernote so much more useful! It’s in the manual under Symbol recognition I believe. You can search for the star symbols in your notes/documents Thanks for the quick reply. Missed it in the manual apparently.

What I do is draw the star next to the note.  Then, I can later tap on what looks like a table of contents symbol in the top left of the menu bar, and the star symbol in the right corner of that menu, and see all of the pages I've starred in that file.

My only gripes are: 1) it doesn't always recognize the star when I draw it, and 2) it would be great if I could select some of the text what I starred so I could see it in the ToC view instead of have to jump to the page in order to read it.",What's up with the supernote converting a drawn pentagram into a perfectly drawn one?,title prediction

"I wasn't sure whether to write this post or not. I was planning on using an ewriter to organise all my notes and lists at home (I seem to generate 100's of sheets of paper). The problem for me is it's for personal use and so not offset against tax etc which means I'm fairly price sensitive and these things are unfortunately close to the limit of what I'll pay.

Getting unbiased info on these devices is quite difficult. The youtube reviewers were very positive on the A5X but then they were very positive on every ewriter they reviewed which didn't really help me much. I ended up trawling through hours of reviews trying to work out the pros and cons of every device and tried to work out what would suit me best. In the end I chose the A5X as I liked the design, the ease of use and the extra functionality that keeps getting added. 

Two days ago I thought damn it, I'll just buy it. I knew the discount price was finished and had convinced myself that the full price was worth it. Then a shipping charge of $57 got added. I figured I better check the functionality to make sure I'm getting exactly what I want and stopped the order. A day later, I'd got the answers I needed here, and I thought I should still go ahead and place my order. I picked the standard package. OK'ed the shipping price, then was told about possible extra taxes etc to the UK. I gave up at that point.

I'm sure the A5X is great but I can't test it before buying and it seems I can't even work out what I'm I'll actually be paying. I decided not go ahead and instead just rely on paper and pencil for the moment. Hopefully it will appear on Amazon in the future and hopefully I'll be able to afford it. I hear you. It's expensive. All these ewriters are. And it's certainly not essential. It's a tough call. I decided (i.e., believe without actually trying yet) that it will work for what I'm looking for (one thing is to free me from needing to sit in front of my computer to read and annotate long PDFs). But I agree that it would be so much nicer to have a model one could try first. If I were you I'd stay connected here because if a deal on a used device comes available, your best bet for hearing about it will be right here. I decided to go ahead and order (with all the extra shipping and taxes to Canada), because I think this will make a big difference in my workflow (for my actual job).

I definitely intend to use the first 30 days (during which it can be returned for full refund) to see if I like it, and it provides the functionality I want/need. As you pointed out, buying expensive ""toys"" without being able to try them first is a bit of a leap, but I have NO PROBLEMS shipping it back for a refund if I decide it won't work for me. Frankly, if more people insisted on good return policies, I think we'd all feel better about buying new/unavailable tech (since we would have the comfort of knowing that it isn't money flushed down the toilet if it ends up not working for us). I would look for a used one if you are really price-conscious. I bought one used for about $40 under the price of new. You may have to wait a little bit, but it is possible. There is a thread for used ones for sale.

I would look for the thread here that has used devices for sale. Exactly. The A5 (non-X) can sometimes be found at a very decent price, it could be an alternative if budget is important and a more minimalist device can work out fine for your needs, [u/mike\_bike\_kite](https://www.reddit.com/user/mike_bike_kite/)",Information and pricing,title prediction

"Hi,  


I have just watched a [video](https://youtu.be/CXjYHtfDP6A?t=2372) where a PDF, filled with hyperlinks is used almost as if it was an app. I believe this is very similar to the zettelkasten feature which I've read about on the subreddit.

  
This idea got me really excited and upon arriving at the section which shows the PDF on the A5X (which I preordered) it is clearly mentioned and shown that you cannot follow hyperlinks with a single tap. There's always that menu which shows ""Jump To"" which you have to tap again.  
Is it possible to configure this (or change the default) behaviour? If not, I would like to request this :-)  
It should be easy to implement and could very well live alongside the actual zettelkasten feature.

&amp;#x200B;

thanks,

Crucidal [deleted] The inner hyperlinks within the documents are available on Supernote A5X, the prompt of "" Jump to“ ， which designs to avoid unintentional touch which caused to jump to a certain hyperlink page by accident, which might also cause some "" inconvenience"". I agree that there is an inconvenience in both scenarios. However, the touch is not over sensitive and in my experience, being able to hit the hyperlink is enough secure in itself to avoid most unintentional jumping. To me it would be awesome with an option to turn this off, just like you can turn off touch recognition. The power of freedom and customization :) My current experience is purely from e-readers like the kindle paperwhite.(is it fair to assume this would translate to the a5X as well?)I've never experienced unintentional touches there. The palm rejection should ""fix"" other scenarios in which you might accidentally press a hyperlink.It seems like the Jump To was built to prevent ""annoyance"" for a use case that probably rarely happens in comparison to how often you intentionally press it.

Handling unintentional navigation could also be solved by providing a means to quickly go back to the previously shown page. either by a temporarily hovering menu or a built-in shortcut (like double tapping the lower left corner or something)Purely looking at ""handling unintentional navigation"" my suggestion takes 2 page refreshes and that's definitely slower than the ""jump to"" menu. But if you would multiply this by some weight which represents how often you unintentionally navigate vs intentionally, I think it would outweigh the drawbacks :-)","feature request: A5X directly follow internal links without showing ""Jump to"" menu?",title prediction

"Hi r/Supernote. 

&amp;#x200B;

I purchased my Supernote A5X in January and have been using it for a few months now. I absolutely love it. I basically don't use real paper anymore. Over the past several months, my Supernote has become one of my most precious items -- I carry it around with me everywhere. It contains my calendar (actually, Voya's calendar, it's really great!), my todo lists, my personal journal and diary, my work documents, and my school documents and papers. The Supernote team should feel proud that they have created and commercialized such a fabulous device. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to suggest some features, but I don't want to imply that I'm not fully satisfied with the product. The Supernote has brought me alot of joy and I really am happy. In the future, here's what my perfect Supernote device would look like:

&amp;#x200B;

Reading &amp; Note Taking Improvements:

* **Split Screen View.** I wish I could view a document and a note side-by-side at the same time, especially if I turned my Supernote sideways.
* **No annotation tag.** Annotations in PDFs have a small circular ""D"" or ""A"" symbol at the end of each selection that blocks the text underneath. Do we really need these symbols? It would be great to turn them off, or to somehow move them to the side so I can read the text underneath. 
* **Improve the Underlining/Annotating Experience.** When trying to underline a sentence in a PDF, it is too easy to grab (1) the leading whitespace before the first word or (2) the trailing whitespace after the last word or period. It would be great if Supernote was smart enough to omit leading and trailing whitespace characters when underlining.
* **Free the Title.** In a Note, do ""Titles"" really need to be obscured with dark diagonal slashes? What is the point of hiding the text underneath the Title? Perhaps I don't understand this function. Wouldn't it be better if, instead, the text was surrounded by a box that you could see through? Why do I want dark squares in my Note? Why do I want to hide the Title?
* **Change the Lasso Icons.** I feel like the lasso icons are backwards. After I lasso a word or phrase in a Note, the box with a ""T"" in it is *not* for ""Title"" -- it creates a keyword. And the box with ""dots and lines"" is not to create keywords, but to create a ""Title"". I keep getting these mixed up because ""T"" = ""Title"". Am I thinking about this wrong?  I feel like these icons should be swapped, or changed completely.
* **Use UTF-8 Encoding in Digest.** The Digest does no seem to have a full set of UTF-8 fonts. For example, the South Korean won symbol, ₩, does not show correctly in the Digest.

&amp;#x200B;

PDF Improvements:

* **PDF to Note copying.** I want to be able to copy text from an annotation/digest (i.e., the text that I have underlined) and paste it into a Note file.  
* **PDF Snip Tool.** I wish I could lasso an area of a PDF and the copy that over to a Note as an image. 
* **Add Layers to PDFs.** Right now, layers only work in Notes. It would be nice to be able to use layers on top of PDFs. 
* **Copy Written Doodles from PDF to Note.** I wish I could write a little note and/or doodle in a PDF and then cut/copy that into a Note. 
* **Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus.** I want a dictionary and thesaurus feature for PDFs and ePubs (and, Notes?). The Kindle app comes bundled with one, but I can't use that feature outside of Kindle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Potential Bugs:

* **Fix E-mail Typo.** When you enter an incorrect e-mail address (e.g., ""supernote@.com"" is an incorrect e-mail address format) then the error message says ""Please check mailbox"" instead of ""please check e-mail address.""
* **Clean up Keywords.** In a Note, when I lasso a word and mark it as a keyword, it appears as a keyword in the menu. Great. But, when I erase the keyword in the Note, the keyword still appears in the menu. Is that normal? 

&amp;#x200B;

Miscellaneous / Other:

* **Creating geometry.** I want to be able to tap two points on my Supernote device with the pen and have a straight line drawn between them. That's it. That's the feature. I just want to draw straight lines between two arbitrary points. 
* **Creating tables.** I want to be able to tap on my Supernote device with the pen and drag it down to create a table (e.g., a 3x3 or 5x5 or 7x7 table). 
* **Search for Keywords in Digest.** I wish I could search for some text in my Digest (not the notes I make in my Digest, but rather the digest printed text itself). 
* **More Quick Access.** Right now, Supernote only allows 4 Documents and/or Notes in the Quick Access area. I wish I could have a more, especially since adding a 5th document/note completely removes the 1st, and unlinking the 5th does not restore the original 1st. 
* **Quick Access List Reordering.** I wish I could reorder the documents and notes shown in the Quick Access list. But this only makes sense if the documents/notes in the Quick Access area are some how ""sticky"" or ""permanent"". My A5x is scheduled to arrive Monday, and this list looks like a great way to help me get started (in terms of ""things that might not work the way I thought they would""). I hope the supernote team sees this, are they active here? Can you actually ""page"" them so they can be sure to see it? This is a great, carefully considered list of requests and I agree with the vast majority of them.

The biggest one, for me, is the ability to draw straight lines between two points. That would solve a big pain point.

Otherwise, like you, I love this thing. Three months in and it’s now indispensable. Yeah, I use a ruler to draw straight lines, like on pen and paper! xD Super notes does review comments, I was hoping they came out with a calendar with reminders.

Thanks!! Square brackets? These create a separate doc called a digest where you can add your notes relating to that section of the pdf. You click on the text to take you to the digest page.

Received custom import tax payment request via email from DHL on 30. April 7:05 am GMT. Paid right after, process was straight forward. (€129 for Ireland with 23% VAT).

"Hi all

*I posted similar to the below in the remarkable subreddit not realising a5x had a sub.

I'm a Psychologist based in Australia and I'm looking to go digital with my in session note taking. I'm looking for some advice as there's a lot of options.

I think I'm leaning towards the a5x or papyr. I've been watching morning coach and my deep guide most of the morning and it seems that these two devices have improved since release/have good customer service.

How would the a5x go with the below?

Priority
- Note taking/writing is #1 for sure
- Custom note templates (I use a session note template)
- Ability to easily erase what I write
- Ability to export/email my notes to my computer
----- If I could export to a specific folder on my computer that would be ideal
- Ability to create flowcharts/diagrams etc easily as I often use a whiteboard in session

Bonus features
- Would be great if I could export my notes to a specific folder on my computer
- I often put a sticky note on my session note to remind me of things to bring up with the client, but I'm not sure if any device could replicate this?
- Being able to bring up pdfs/highlight and write on them
- Ability to screenshare
- Ability to create a to do list
- Handwriting to text. My hand writing is pretty chicken scratch, but this could be useful in future as I write the same words a lot (so text prediction too)

If anyone has any other suggestions I would be more than happy to hear them. I love my A5X and think it checks off all of your must have boxes and many of your bonus features as well. 

* I really like the writing experience and find it very natural and easy to write on. 
* You can set the note template to be anything you want. There are tons of community created templates and creating custom ones is very simple and straight forward. 
* If you go with the standard or HOM supernote pens, you don't get an eraser button but I don't find it a hassle to switch to the eraser  in the tool bar. I also like the lasso eraser feature a lot and find it easy to use. 
* I have my supernote synced via dropbox. So whenever I choose, all of the files are synced to my computer for reference. You can set up specific folders in dropbox and the files will transfer flawlessly between them. I've never had an easier cloud-syncing experience. 
* I'm not quite sure what you mean by creating diagrams. With Supernote, you are able to draw like you would on a piece of paper. They've hinted at potentially adding drag and drop shapes to notes as well.
* Supernote has several options for marking up and bookmarking documents so you can go back to them later. This might work fo you. 
* You can bring up and write on PDFs. Highlighting is a little strange because its only B/W but it does work.
* Screen sharing is not an option :(
* There are to do list templates and quick access features that make to do lists a breeze to create and update on supernote. 
* I think they are working on handwriting to text for notes but it's not an option yet. 

I cannot recommend supernote enough. I really like the design decisions that Ratta made. The pen loop and aluminum rail system keep the pen and device attached to the folio in a more secure way than magnets do. The writing experience feels great. And the supernote team has been so responsive and listens to the community. This is massively helpful - thank you. You've answered everything so I really appreciate it. I'll have to make though I can avoid using the cloud when it comes to client related notes while still having the ability to export/email them to myself. So I'll ask supernote about that. You can also transfer via usb. 

There is an email function, and I assume that you can send attachments via it (but I haven't used it as I wanted a distraction free device for writing)",Questions on a5x features,title prediction
"Hello Supernote users! I recently updated my Supernote A5X (the day after the newest update came out) and the new features are really great additions. However... the past two days I noticed immense battery drainage. I left my half-charged (give or take) Supernote overnight, waking up to 6%. The day after, left an 85% charged device, only to find it at 55%. Now, this is a HUGE battery drainage problem... and if this is coming from the update, I'm wondering if anyone else had noticed it AND if anyone has considered going down one update for this very reason? As much as I like being able to save my notes as a vector, the last thing I need is my device to feel like my phone, something to constantly be worried about with battery life.

"Hi Can we turn off the jump to request? I have hyperlinked PDF files and I would like to navigate a tad faster by clicking only once?

PS. In love with my A5X xx Our team has discussed this internally. The reason why there is no direct jump is that we lack a shortcut for ""go back"". If the user accidentally triggers the jump, it is inconvenient to return to the previous page. We are developing a convenient way to go back, and at that time, we will enable direct jumps. :) Perfect, thanks ! That's an interesting problem. I know I'm biased here, but I imagine the number of users wanting to go forward with one click far outweighs the number of exceptions of a miss click.

It's just a shame to see videos of the REmarkable clicking through at a high pace for a nice UX feel and the A5X having that friction of double touch...even though you've already built the equivalent capability.

I am being tempted by the Remarkable's texture and pen tool.  Convince me otherwise!

I have ordered the LAMY pen to compare the difference and ordered the Remarkable knowing I can return.  I do a LOT of drawing and my senses are highly sensitive.  I thought I read somewhere about someone who's screen was more textures on. one device than another.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there a way to get a more textured (less slick) drawing experience on the Supernote? Screen protector? Pen?
2. Anyone know if there is a Pencil tool in the works?

(Please know, as much as I am enjoying RM2, Supernote has my heart) No and I don’t know. Just stick with the RM2 if you like drawing. 1.No, you can't add a screen protector because you already have one and you can't remove it because the ceramic pen works with it. For me the first advantage of the ceramic tip is that the tip is thinner.

2) Yes, the pencil brush will be available soon and I look forward to it. The algorithm is done since the beginning of the year, you can see a demo on Supernote's Twitter here :

"I know another one of these threads. I promise I read through as much as I could before posting here but want some fresh perspectives on this given my needs with a device like this.

Both of these devices seem great but I'm torn on which one to get. For my use, I'll only be writing (no drawing or sketching) and I'll primarily be using the device for work meeting notes, to do lists, and daily bullet journaling. I will not use the eReader functionality (already have a Kindle for that) or the PDF viewer/markup functionality. This will be a purely writing device for me. I watched some YouTube videos and both have pros and cons and I can't figure out which one is best for my use. 

The reMarkable 2 looks beautiful and is super thin, which is nice. I also like its UI much better than the Supernote UI - I don't feel like I'll be multi-tasking on a device like this much as I won't be going back and forth between a PDF and notes or anything like that and I don't mind a couple extra presses to get back to my notes (though it looks like rm2's upcoming 2.7 firmware is going to add improved navigation for quickly switching between documents too). The rm2 also has the better OCR, which is something I know I'll use frequently. I already used this often on my Surface to convert handwritten notes. The remarkable 2 also exports writing in a non-rasterized format which is a nice pro. 

The A5X has much better organization options like bookmarks and searching - which would be immensely helpful. The pen is also looking like a huge plus here. I love real luxury pens and own a few fountain pens. So the options Supernote offers are really nice. Plus not ever having to replace the nib is huge and seems like it'd be a nice money save over time. The Supernote also seems to make templates much easier to create and use - which I would for things like my bullet journaling.

My final concerns are price and support. I could use a referral code for the rm2 and get it for over $100 cheaper than the A5X. But I've also heard bad stories of remarkable's support and it's nice to see Supernote engaging with the community. But I also worry that despite that engagement, if something goes wrong I have to send things back overseas which could be expensive or cause long delays (I'm in the US).

Would love to hear the thoughts of people who were trying to decide between the two as well. Especially if you use your device similar to how I described I would above. Thanks! Tough call. Personally, I ended up returning my RM2 and went for the Supernote, see my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/n2ieu3/advice_a5x_vs_rm2/gwyemv3/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Then again, my use case is different.

Why don't you try out the Remarkable and see how you like it? (They offer free returns, after all.)

One thing I'd keep in mind: The writing experience. This is a very personal thing and, personally, I prefer the feeling of the Supernote. &gt; see my comment here

Thanks for that. Helpful. Your points about the areas rm2 wins are also things to consider. Seems like the responsiveness is better. Also the recent 2.6 update seems to have fixed the jagged lines issue on the remarkable. 

&gt; Why don't you try out the Remarkable and see how you like it? (They offer free returns, after all.)

This is a good point. Though I'd feel bad about using someone's referral code only to return the device so they don't get the credit.

Honestly though, if the Remarkable 2 had bookmarks and tags that were searchable it'd probably win for me pretty easily. Though I'd still be lusting after the Supernote's pens and nibs you don't need to replace. I use my device primarily for note taking and planning.  (Consulting on clients). I also purchased both to see which would be better.  SUPERNOTE won.  For me it came to writing, my handwriting needed a .5 and the RM2 was not fine enough and when I switched to the pencil thin, it was too light and hard to read.  As much as I liked the look and feel, it was a deal breaker.  Also, the nib replacement just seemed a hassle.  Love the durability of Supernote.  Supernote can save to cloud or OneDrive which I like, but there is a lot more storage on Supernote than RM2.
Would like to see more “helpful” hints from the company but right now the 3rd party people are doing a nice job for me.
Hope this helps! Thanks. I appreciate this perspective. The pen is a huge reason why I'm still unsure which one to go with. The Supernote's pens all seem superior to anything else on the market - both in feeling like a real pen and also the thinness of the nib. Definitely something I'm putting a lot of weight behind. But so much else about the rm2 seems better for my use cases.",Supernote A5X or reMarkable 2?,title prediction

"Hello Supernote team!  
I just recently purchased a used Supernote device and love the fact that you promote the second hand market for Supernote devices, instead of trying to squash it (I am looking at you Apple!). The ability to buy and sell Supernote devices is amazing because it not only gives a Supernote buying ""*insurance""*  that they can sell the device if it does not work for them, or help those who cannot pay full price afford one, but it also helps keep ewaste out of the landfills.   


That said, while going through the process of finalizing a deal there we were a couple things that concerned/annoyed me though.   
1. Very few rules - Normally anytime you are buying and selling something on Reddit the subreddit has strict rules that help prevent scams. Some of these include recent timestamped photos, addition to the universal scammer list, only allowing payment through paypal goods and services, having the buyer/seller say which state they live in, and a flair that shows how many trades a user has. A perfect example of these rules is r/hardwareswap and r/AVexchange. Implementing some of these rules would greatly help everyone avoid scams.  


2. Hard to find people selling - People who were selling their devices often not only used the trades mega thread but also made new posts or commented on other posts. This caused an issue where it was hard to know if you were seeing all the people interested in selling their devices or not.   


3. Vague price history - Often times the original post showing the final sale price was gone so it was hard to determine what a good deal was or not. Making sure these stay up would greatly help everyone know they are getting a good deal. 

4. Sellers not including screenshots or condition - Most of the time sellers did not include a link to pictures/timestamps of their device so it was hard to detriment what exactly they were selling in what condition.   


Ways to implement these suggestions:  
I think that the best possible way to keep the Supernote market safe and avoid blocking out other content in this subreddit is to create a new subreddit specifically for buying/selling/trading Supernote devices. This new subreddit would then be added to the USL (universal scammers list) and would have strict rules on how people can make posts. Any person who wanted to buy/sell a device could then make a post and the seller/buyer could sort these posts by new in the subreddit getting an up to date list of the resent buying/selling requests. Flairs could be added to further improve the process with Buying, Selling, and Closed tags being used to show the status of a post. Lastly, each post would be able to include pictures and a detailed title so that the buyer and seller can meet quickly and effectively.  


Thanks so much for reading our feedback! I hope this post is helpful. Thank you for sharing your opinion with us, to avoid scams and make our users can get a Supernote device through a trustful channel is our wishes. Hope our users can be more cautious and prudent during the transactions of a used device. What we can do is limited at this stage, look forward to a chance to discuss more with you in the future.

"I've had an issue with my Supernote A5 since I got it almost a year ago and I was wondering if anybody else had the same problem.

I cannot charge the device with a USB-C to USB-C cable. It works fine with the included USB-A to USB-C cable, and with any other A to C cable I've tried. But if the cable is USB-C on both ends (like the MacBook charger) absolutely nothing happens. I've tried this with multiple cables and multiple transformers with the same (lack of) results.

Does anyone else have this issue, or do I have a faulty device? This is frustrating because it means I need a dedicated charger for my Supernote, while the rest of my devices (laptop, phone, keyboard, etc) can all charge from the same cable. If it is a problem with the device, is there any way to get a fix or replacement? Bit surprised you haven't contacted CS if it's been happening for almost a year. I think there were a few customers who had problems with the included cable last year but it can't be that if you've tried multiple cables and chargers. 

Feedback to customer service, via your device, is your best course of action. There are the usual things to try, hard reset, swapping cable around, clean the port (but then you've got it to work with USB-A) etc or it could be a software fault. I'm sure they'll help you resolve your problem I was actually waiting until I got around to getting another cable and adapter to test it out before contacting customer service, and to make sure it wasn't just something about the the USB hardware they use.

I'll contact them, thanks.

I use my Supernote A5 for a lot of grading, and overall it works great for getting feedback to students. I don't use Google Classroom but I can speak to the other aspects of the workflow.

The workflow is a little awkward, however. It's easy enough to get a folder full of PDFs of the student submissions onto the device and to mark them up. But because the Supernote wants to leave the original PDF untouched, you need to export each marked-up document individually (as far as I know there is no way to export an entire folder in one action). This takes usually betweeen 5 and 30 seconds per document depending on its length, which interrupts the grading flow a bit. The exported files are in a totally different directory, named the same as the original document. I usually end up manually copying these files somewhere to be uploaded back to my LMS.

I would **love** it if they implemented an ""export entire folder"" option, or else if there were some way to have the exporting of marked-up PDFs happen automatically in the background.

There might be a smoother workflow with Word .docx files if you get an X-series Supernote.

Still, the Supernote has made marking up student papers and essays *much* easier overall. I no longer need to either (a) print them all out or (b) fiddle with PDF markup on my computer.

Hope this helps a bit! Thank you. This definitely helps! How do your students feel about your comments? Are they able to see and read them easily? Aside from my bad handwriting, yes!

The annotations are a bit pixelated but nobody seems to have had an issue yet. Also, I think the pixelation issue has been solved on the X-series with vector-based exports (which is allegedly coming to the A5 … *eventually*?)",Question about use with Google Classroom/Drive,title prediction
" Hi! Since this morning I’m having a problem when trying to update my a5x, and some more issue. When I try to update it (I’m still at 238 version), through settings&gt;system&gt;software update&gt;check, it just tells me the device is updated. Wifi connection, of course, is on, and I can check my email, but I cannot synchronize though supernote cloud, because when I try, it immediately opens the last doc I read. And finally, if I try to upload the log (system&gt;feedback&gt;upload logs), it tells me “upload failed”. I restart and reboot 3 times, and no variations. Please, give me some indications about what I’m supposed to do. Thanks It should've updated around two weeks ago. My advice is to contact customer service via email and include your device number.

" Thanks a lot! Very good video as always :) I agree with you, it may be missing an option to choose the type of eraser but anyway we will enjoy it ! Just have to be patient for the ""X"" owners. I'm using the 5X this morning, and really miss the erase gesture already! lol Could you tell us if this gesture is possible to execute while holding the device in one hand and writing with the other? Or are you forced to put down the device on your lap or table? I wonder if this specific use case was a part of the troubleshooting when Supernote developed this gesture, u/mulan_sn or u/hex2asc? I've been trying to imitate the gesture on my A6X, but find it a bit difficult to find a natural/working way for two fingers to touch while holding the device in my left hand and the pen in my right hand. The whole premise of the two finger gesture suggests that you have a free hand available in the first place but it's *not impossible* to get two fingers on the screen using the hand holding the device. 

However, as stated from your own trial, it's really awkward and very uncomfortable to get the finger positioning right to successfully activate the function. 

The developers have done a lot of work to refine the gesture and activation zones to prevent as much accidental or false positive activation as possible due to extra stray fingers on the screen including the writing hand making contact with the screen while writing.",Supernote A5 and A6 UPDATE!

"I was just eagerly waiting for my Supernote to be shipped. The long waiting time is not great but is something I understood but I had to cancel my order 3 days before shipping since I looked randomly into the return policy.  Not free return policy and good will return for such devices is just not what I expect. Do you by any chance live in the US?

I read complaints about a lack of free international returns but tbh that's not the norm where I live and, I think, a lot of the world... so calling it *a joke* is a bit harsh and a little US (and maybe EU?)-centric. If I bought a Remarkable, for example, their free return policy wouldn't apply to me since I live in Asia. I guess I would wait for them to set up US/EU warehouses for cheaper shipping in your case.

Edit: The only places I know of here with free international returns are big companies like Lazada (owned by Alibaba; think Amazon) that do logistics in massive volume. How long does this company take to ship? I ordered my A6 X four days ago and have yet to receive a confirmation email. I have only gotten the PayPal receipt. I know they are supposed to have good customer service, but I would at least like to know that my order is being processed. Usually ships within a few days and as far as I remember they sent me a despatch email ( though that doesn't always mean the parcel is physically with the carrier.) I do remember that the tracking was slow to update. See whether anything comes through by Monday then pop them an email to check. Could be they're just busy. Appreciate that we'd all like a free return. However, some people buy it just to try it out, some order at least two devices from different companies with the sole intention of only keeping one. They are a relatively new company, so if a lot of people send devices back, they're losing money. Perhaps, one day they'll be in a position to but likely it could increase the cost for others.

There is the option of selling it, as others have done.

Method 1: Then click the PDF on the cloud page, it will automatically download the exported PDF after clicking and converting (with the .mark files)   
  
Please do not download from the cloud directly without the above steps, otherwise, it is possibly to download the original “blank” pdf without annotations.  
   
Method 2: You can also open/click the exported pdf with annotation from the My device-&gt; Export folders, (The exported pdf will be downloaded automatically)  
  
Additionally，when exporting the PDF on the device, whether you choose “original” or “Vector”. For a vector pdf, If the pdf parsing software cannot open it ( or open without annotation), please try to open it directly with a browser.  
Not sure that whether it is clear enough, please try it. It worked - Thank you!!

Mike I don't have my device yet - it's currently in transit from China. So I can't help you with the first couple. But the pen is not magnetic. They recommend you use the case because it has the pen holder loop on the side for it. 

And as far as I know, the Kindle app only lets you connect to the Kindle service. I'm *pretty sure* you have to use the built in reader to read epub and pdf files you transfer to the device. 1- You don't need the Kindle app to view ebooks. Kindle app is only for accessing kindle books. Supernote can read most ebook formats. Edit: To use LAN, you need the Supernote Partner App.

2- You can put those files anywhere. But the ideal place to do it is in the Documents folder. Putting them in the Notes folder may cause some confusion.

3- Check your email or spam for a privacy or insecure connection alert to enable it.

4- No. You can keep the cap in the pen loop. If you have the standard pen and not HOM, it will be roomy in the pen loop. Many thanks.

Don't suppose you know why the USB won't connect? It seems I can write to the supernote cloud drive and then sync.

"Hello

I have supernote A5x and A6x. I need the two devices to have the same content.

I'm logged in on both devices with the same account (email address). They are not mirroring. on the ratta supernote cloud, it only shows the A6x's content

I've tried to log out and log in on A5x: doesn't work... 

what do I have to do ? Curious about this question myself.  Thinking of getting an A6X for the smaller form factor.  But if they are treated as completely discrete devices and there are no seamless integration options, despite them sharing the same email account, why not consider a non-Sn as a second device just for variety? X series can share the same account(login with one account), while the non-X series can share the same account. You can log in on your new device with your existing Supernote account.  
  
Users need to be careful to keep both devices in sync with each other. Generally, the steps are like following:  
1: A6X writes notes  
2: A6X  sync  
3：A5X sync  
4: A5X writes notes again.  
.......  
Repeat the above steps

I second this. I have an A6X and A5X and they sync with each other fine. Same for me. I have A5X and A6X, and the content syncs fine.

Re Google. Sure it's been mentioned/requested, so believe it'll be possibility in a future update but don't take this as gospel. I work with two devices A5x and A6x, and they can be synced if you what entails correspond to your needs:

1. **Sync is manual, and therefore, not real time**. That means that when you do a change on your device you need to do **every time** you want to use ""collaborative"" documents.
   1. press the sync button on the top drawer, to check if any change has been made since the last sync by someone else
   2. make the changes you need to do
   3. press again the sync button to make sure what on the cloud mirror the content of your device
   4. hoping that no one is doing the same on another device (see 3 below)
2. **Sync does sync the notes but not the ""smart annotation""**. See here point 3, on my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/nnr2nv/do_annotations_exist_outside_my_a5x_or_a6x_device/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). If that's what you need upvote the post linked.
3. **Sync granularity is the file level**, I think, but unsure. I, personally, notice that if I want to sync two devices at the same time, there is an alert on the second one, saying that the cloud is already busy syncing on another device. **What I fear it means is that** : during the time device A is syncing (making some useful changes; let's say to your task list), you can't sync. Then, when the cloud is done syncing A, you start syncing your device B. If, for some reason, the changes you made to the task list on device B is ulterior to the one made on device A, that (probably) means, you'll overwrite changes made by device A, **losing device A changes**.

Based on these remarks, and the fact that you have a team of 8 people (imagine this hassle is x8), **I would recommend going for a device that as a granularity of stroke change, and is in ""real time""**.

If you want to stay in e-inks, I would therefore recommend looking **Mobiscribe Origin: MobiShare**. Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/K35CFZlKC9M) testing the sharing capabilities.

"Thank you for the new firmware update. It adds some very useful features.

Is there any way that you could add pressure sensitivity adjustment/calibration in a future update? I have several styli which I find more comfortable than the Supernote stylus and the default pressure sensitivity is far too high for them. 

Also, in a previous firmware version, the button on a Lamy EMR stylus triggered the selection erase tool when held down. It now does nothing. Can this be re-instated as it was a very useful feature? The eraser on other styli still works fine.

"Since A6X is on Android, I *supposed* we can install Microsoft OneNote app, and take notes directly into MS OneNote.  Supernote, can you please comment if this is possible? Yes, As it's an Android device, you may do that. But you have to wait a few months. At the beginning, we will block any third-party APP until A6X runs stability.

And I should inform you that handwriting latency will increase by using OneNote. Because of slow refresh rate of E Ink Screen, Supernote's note app access the display layer directly. We call this EPA technology (EPaper Accelerator) while OneNote does nothing special for that.

We will not exclude attempts to install third-party applications, and we will establish an application store to encourage users to help us collect applications suitable for ink screens.

For us, our main goal is to develop note-taking application, which needs to be adapted to the disadvantages of gray scale display, low refresh rate and so on. It should perform better than other apps while runs on E Ink Device.

So I think you will have opportunity to try both solutions, from MS or from ours. :) Hi Bruce!

Thanks for the transparent insight :) I agree about your view about the technology and the consumer demands and I hope that your decision will pay off.

One of my concerns with Android as an OS of choice is the latency. Can you say that there will be no decrease in latency (even better, an improvement) with using Android? (The EPA tech sounds great!)

Also, as it is an Android-based software, is it okay to expect some basic functionalities as Web browser, keyboard pairing, etc?

I am really happy that your company is very communicative. Can't wait to join the fam! (would be super cool if you'd have a EU warehouse ;) ) Appreciate the communication and transparency in this.  :)

Perhaps another way for me would be to OCR it in A6X's note taking app, and then export it to OneNote then. This is a good idea!  If we plan to export doc/docx format, why not add one more format as OneNote. We will check that if we can do.",Will A6X be able to sync to Microsoft OneNote?,title prediction
"Is there a reason that Supernote have sent 8 emails about their A6X pre-order offer in the last 30 minutes? There doesn’t appear to be an option to unsubscribe either, which is a bit naughty these days?

Personally, although I really do want to get a Supernote A6X , I’m not going to pre-order anything until I see something a bit more concrete than some screen shots. Not the most thought-out piece of sales literature. Where are the specs, has the latency improved, what are the differences between A6 and A6X...... anything?!  Eight emails,  It's very high treatment. I think they see you as a big buyer. :) We should say sorry, It seems they send everyone 8 emails... It's our mistake.

"Anyone else feel that they are really missing the ability to search for a specific word in their handwritten notes?

I primarily would use this device to take meeting notes. That is the reason Im holding back from buying at this point. SUPERNOTE doesn't have the ability to search hand written notes at this time. However the A6X migth have the ability when it comes out but for mi used I think is too small I need the A5 with that fuction. I really think that constraint is that they don't have OCR readily on their Linux OS (on the other hand, it's one of the main features of the Remarkable). As a consequence, one cannot really map the handwriting to the alphabets for searching..

Prolly also that the software is originally introduced in Chinese/Japanese, so English support is minimal.

Maybe Android will change things as there are lots existing solutions out there. Let's see =) But do you personally feel that you need to search through your notes sometimes? Of course! It's also on my wish list as well. But I could imagine it not being on the top of their priority especially the introduction of the new OS.

"Was quite interested in getting an A5 but was really put off by the fact that there is no way of returning an opened device. I have bought devices in the past that might have worked well for others but just didn't suit me. And so, in less than a few days, they were returned. Given that there is no place for me to try the device, I think it's pretty unfortunate there is no return option. I understand they are a small company that's just starting out but I'd also have been okay if they charged a restocking fee. 

How do you guys feel about their no return policy? Just wanted some different perspectives. I understand your concerns. Our marketing department will internally discuss the return policy in order to better serve our users, especially those early customers who find us. Thank you very much for kind understanding.

As for return policy, we assume Supernote buyers are familiar with E-paper device and operation system and here are reasons we put the policy.

Some customers had impulse buy with less consideration of the need they really want. We would like to avoid such lose-lose result.

We have been suffering by free return policy for some surprising reasons, such as

\- The display size is too small or too big

\- No color display

\- Just dislike it anymore

\- Need some cash back urgent for other

Please understand that we provide one-year warranty with free replacement and DHL delivery for obvious malfunctions or defects as a responsibility to customers, but we cannot afford for nonsense return. We fully understand that most customers are reasonable and kind, but things keep happening. We are a young company doing all we can to improve our product for people's daily lives.

We know this is never a cheap purchase so we appreciate every customer who places order and uses Supernote to make daily life more efficient and meaningful as our 4F slogan: Feel &amp; Find, Free &amp; Fun. It’s not great, especially when they are expecting customers to purchase, at least at the moment, based on a “goodwill” policy, in that there is hardly any info at all available on the A6X. 
I dunno about anyone else, but I would always try and get as much info as possible on something that was going to cost me several hundreds of pounds, but that info isn’t available. I really do understand that there will be timewasters, people who don’t like the colour, etc, but you’d like to think those were in the minority. The point made about a restocking fee seems fair, perhaps something along the lines of even half the purchase price, so it would sting if you sent it back,(for non-defect reasons, obviously ), but wouldn’t be a complete loss for either side?
I’m waiting for two things before purchasing the A6X, one is more information, videos, specs etc and the other is a European distributor so I don’t end up having to pay a third of the price in shipping and taxes! That's a really disappointing reply that I think you copy/pasted from somewhere else in this thread or your website (so no real discussion?). I have mentioned maybe even instituting a restocking fee to discourage frivolous returns from customers. You haven't addressed that. None of the examples you mentioned (why people return devices) capture the writing experience, that's the one thing we can't test by watching videos. ""the no returns due to a small percentage of potentially bad customers"" approach doesn't reciprocate the goodwill you seem to be expecting from your customers. 

Anyhow, you guys are allowed to run your company however you think is best and I wish you all the best for that.",No returns on opened devices?,title prediction

" Thanks, good share.  I understand Mandarin (Chinese) so here are some takeaways:

Looks like there are some interface changes on the tool bar and also the way the notes are displayed.

10:40 - The Lamy pen feels the same as the 1st generation heart of metal pen (Plastic nib). The reviewer said there's a bit of ""stickiness"" feeling when writing.  He feels that the 2nd generation ceramic nib feels better when writing. 

12:20 - He was comparing the Weixin ebook reading app, I think.  He mentioned the speed seems to be comparable with another ebook reader and looks nice.  Chinese Font on the A6X seems to be smaller and doesn't seem to have a setting to change that in the Chinese ebook reader app he is using.  

13:37 - He mentioned the writing experience is quite good.  Will be continuing further reviews as he uses the A6X in the coming weeks. Thanks so much! I received one. 
I can do a quick video if that helps.

Can confirm the stickiness of the Lamy nib, don’t have ceramic to compare. 

Shout your questions and I’ll answer :) Thanks! :)  Can you please share your experience of the ebook reading?  Things I'm looking at:

\- Table of content

\- Annotations: is it easy (just write directly?)

\- Can you export annotations easily?

\- Can you still draw a line across the screen and then do note taking split screen?

\- Press-and-hold on a word for dictionary (is it available yet)?

"I have a Onyx Boox with note taking from work, but the A6X appeals to me.  However, I've found it very hard to make pencil-like sketches due to the lack of pressure sensitivity to opacity on the Onyx.  Though the brush gets thinner with low pressure, it's still 100% pure black.

Most of the first pre-orders have been shipped and many customers in Japan, China, Europe and the U.S. have already received the A6 X. We look forward to you sharing your creations on the A6 X!

1. The region selection edit tool affects the erasing effect.

2. Margins are too large (EPUB)

3. Confusion caused by two different entrances, the right tag bar and the file manager.

Personally, I want to have one of those eink device to take notes at work, read epub pdf and blogs. So the only think really missing on A5 is the browser.

Any thoughts on that?

For the A5, it is harder to integrate a browser, but out of concern for our users, we will try out as many solutions as possible, without guaranteeing results. If the browser is crucial to you, ""X"" series could be a better option at this stage.

"Hi, I've just updated my A6X with the C.063 firmware. Thank you for the correction on the selection tool after the erasing action. It works. 😊

I wanted to tell you I found the following bugs:

- Eraser: with the previous version, when I chosed the ""region eraser"" or used the eraser on the Lamy pen I could delete just a part of a continuos stroke, just the area I selected. With the update I can only erase a complete stroke, even if I select just a part of it. And if I choose the ""regular eraser"" I cannot change its thickness, even if I go to ""pen"", change its thickness and then ""regular eraser"", it is always small.

- Folders: I still find the confusion we had on the previous version, but now I know that if I want to see the files stored in a folder I have to use the side bar, go to Inbox and then select the folder I need. It would be just great if I could see my files even if I choose for example ""Documents"" or ""Notes"" on the side bar and then select the correct folder.

- Png: I don't know why, but when I select a png file, the device tells me ""Unsupported file format"". I can see the thumbnail, but can't open it. It happened also with the previous version.

I know you are working hard on further updates, so maybe you are able to add some of these amendments.
And thank you for this amazing device! Hey there,

Thank you for your detailed feedback.

Eraser: To improve user-friendliness, we are optimizing the region erasing algorithm for a smarter approach.

Folders: in this release we have only tweaked the UI to reduce confusion and will bring subsequent improvements in later updates.

One option to go around this problem is to use the star mark. You basically draw a star on a page and the device recognizes it. After, you can search for star marks in any note document you have and it will display small sized pages where you have a star. Therefore, if you underline some important keyword on a page with one of these marks, you can find that word with no problem. So it's still better than a regular paper notebook. Also consider that you don't have to use paper or carry tons of notebooks with you. Everything is in one device. It is fast, good to write on, and everything is tidy and accessible.
I have been using A5 device everyday for roughly a month now. I use it as a notebook and (mostly) as a PDF reader. Besides the very good writing experience, fast processing, etc., the best part is that I don't use paper anymore and everything is cleaned and organized from the beginning. I would recommend it.
That being said, if you really need a handwritten notes conversion function and don't want to tackle the problem by the means that supernote offers, there may be other devices on the market more suitable for you. Yes, we have the same idea as you. So we made a similar function in A6X. My colleague will post a video later, please confirm if this is what you want.

Once this function is approved by our users, we will apply it to A5/A6. Hi there, you can convert your handwriting to text and set it to keywords for easy searching and indexing.

"Do you guys think that this would be possible? I use OneNote for **a lot** of things and it would be so awesome if SuperNote could sync with them. :-)

I thought of this after my integration with Dropbox completely broke on my A5. Maybe another idea would be to add more slots for quick access? I keep a lot of my notebooks separate and having more than 4 items in the quick access bar would be a gamechanger for me. If this feature comes through Supernote would make an immediate impact on the professionals market (potentially grabbing a chunk of it from iPad). I see OneNote used in the industry a lot, yet very few who use it write up the notes on iPad. In my area we use ordinary notebooks and then retype the notes in OneNote (it is considered unprofessional to type notes in a customer meeting). If I had this sync - that would be the feature I'd be using hte most.  


The key thing though - it should support the corporate sharepoint accounts somehow (OneNote can use sharepoint as the sync backend). Completely agree! None of these devices have that functionality so it would really cater to a very specific target market. Posted this sometime back.  They replied:

"I have had a Supernote A5 for close to two months now, and overall I love it. It has changed the way I work and has made me much more productive.

 However I have been surprised at the poor quality of the images in exported notes. It seems like they export as raster images at the same resolution as the Supernote screen. When I view them on a larger, higher-resolution computer screen the lines look very jagged and pixelated, and zooming in on a note makes this worse (see the attached doodle).

Is there a reason that Supernote does not export to PDF with a vector-based image, like I believe the reMarkable does? I believe this would help the notes look much more legible and clear when read on a computer.

"I wish to use one for home and another for work, but would like both to sync from the same Dropbox account.

I mainly use notes and would like notes to sync on both devices. Interesting question. How do you think the sync should work? My understanding of the sync process is that it doesnt sync unless i explicitly pulldown then top nav bar and hit the sync button.

So, for simplicitly/Minimum Viable Product, i think they should let the end users control sync i.e. if there is a sync conflict (i.e server file updated by another device), they provide the option to a) retain file on device, overwrite on server (cloud) b) retain file on server, overwrite on device. Yes,you can.
And one more thing need to know is that  a6x is trying a new note file format which differently with ""none x"" series(A5,A6). So if you sync one of A5/A6 type with another of A6X type. Each one would fail to open the note file created by another.

"Just got the A6X today and I have to say that as a person who much prefers pen over pencil, it is really nice to write with. I've had the rM1 for about 4 months now and here's my initial thoughts comparing the two. (Background - I'm part designer and researcher and I make things with my hands so I'm very sensitive to the tools I use)

Screen - I thought that the A6X's 300dpi screen would mean that the lines I write would be less pixelated and smoother-looking than the 226dpi of the rM tablet but that's not the case. 

Size - I thought the smaller 7.8"" diagonal screen size would feel like I'm losing out on screen real estate. I don't feel that way because of the finer tip on the pen. The size is more portable than the rM dimensions and I feel like I can take it everywhere with me.

Pen - It's a comfortable weight to write with. The style reminds me of the Pilot Razor Point felt tip pen that I used to use a lot. The finer nib and the feeling that I can press as hard as I need to is mentally relieving. I did not realize how hard I write until I've switched back to pen and paper after using the rM1. The standard rM1 marker feels to me like trying to write with a hollow plastic tube. I also have the LAMY AL-Star and that feels too bulky for my medium-large hand with skinny long fingers. Sometimes when I press the button on it a short line appears out of nowhere on the rM1. I don't have any mods on my rM1.

Writing feel - Wow. Everyone's been saying it's hard to describe. Here's my attempt. My go-to paper for writing is very smooth, about 25% of the way to glossy paper, and I usually use the Muji retractable pen, the one that looks like the Sarasa retractable pen, 0.5mm. It's a ballpoint. Compared to that, writing on the A6X is like if the ballpoint is not rolling, but instead it's gliding. The sound of writing is quieter than the rM, which is quieter than pen on paper. It sounds like you're writing on paper with a smooth paper texture, but that's if you're writing with a light hand. The harder you press down, you'll get less of that scratchy sound. When you first put the pen to the A6X screen, you'll hear a tap sound kind of like Apple Pencil on iPad but quieter. It's louder if you're holding the pen at an angle, and quieter if you're writing on it such that the pen is tangent to the surface (or orthogonal or uhhh straight down for the laymen terms). The rubber texture provides more resistance the harder you press when writing. If you press too hard, it's a lot of friction. But that means that you get more haptic feedback if you're going slow and trying to be precise in your lines. If you're pressing hard and want to write fast, it's gonna feel like too much friction. On that note, I can see the indent of the lines on the screen surface when I write hard and it quickly disappears. So that's good. 

Colors - the A6X has 4 colors. White, light gray, dark gray, and black. I don't see myself using the white one very much. Compared to the rM1 which has white, gray, and black (and light gray for highlighter), this means that I can use the A6X for planning website layouts. Light gray would be content boxes and then darker gray can be non-text content. I would fill in actual content with black. 

Switching between tools - It's nice that it's only one tap to switch to the highlighter or marker(?) on the A6X. On the rM1, this requires two taps and then reading from the list to pick what you want to use. Unless you've got the positions all memorized. For me, this means that it is faster to write headings and highlight important content so that I can structure my notes clearly and visually. 

Interface and some features - It's not as obvious how to get to the Settings menu like on the rM interface. You have to know to swipe down from the top and the mini tutorial at the beginning does not cover that. I love the lasso select text as a heading for a table of contents. That way, I don't have to look through the pages to find what I'm looking for. Compared to the rM1, this means that I will not have to create a new notebook for each topic or subtopic. I can just select the text to be a header. 

Cover - I got the default cover. The front cover feels a bit too lightweight and it wiggles around easily. I can see where the round magnet is on the inside of the front cover, which is not a problem. 

Questions - 

1. I'm trying to sync with Dropbox. There's no new folder on my Dropbox or I can't find it. Do I need to have a Supernote account for this to work? I'm hoping I don't need that. 

2. I'd like to use the nib in a different pen chassis. I was able to unscrew the front piece near the tip but can't seem to get the nib out. Can I even do that with this updated ceramic version?

3. I made a test notebook that's just 2 pages of scribbles. Why is it 2MB? I like that it does tell me how big the file is but I imagine if I have 100 pages, it may be 100MB. So about 2000 pages would be 1GB. So the 22GB of user space I have on the A6X would give me like 44,000 pages. Much less than the rM's advertised 100,000 pages on 8GB. 3. I wrote about the file size as well and the support team replied saying that they will fix that issue in future updates. They said that they are well aware of the issue and they have a potential fix that will be part of one of the future updates. 
Hopefully that future update will be before you reach the 44,000 page limit? Lol just kidding 😅 

Enjoy your A6X, I think its a marvelous tool with an equally amazing &amp; very active team behind it. Cheers. Thanks! Glad they’re going to fix the issue. 

I quite enjoy it so far, much more than I have enjoyed my rM1 in the past months. I think I may have found the right one for me. To read your notes in Dropbox, first export them als pdf or png.

"Had a quick question-what type of charger is recommended for charging my A6X to have better battery life. I read in Onyx Boox posts that fast charging was causing lot of battery issues. 

Is it ok to charge my A6X with a fast charger? Or should it be a small charger? Or a computer perhaps (as the package did come just with a cable and no plug 🔌) 

Want to keep my Supernote for ever 😁 A6X support USBPD (the main fast charge standard). It's a negotiation protocol. When plugged, the charger will ask A6X, ""how much current you want?"", and A6X always answer,""1.5A is enough"". So the charger will start supply current limited by the agreement. You need not worry about too much current would damage the device. Typically A6X will get full charged in 2 hours by a 7.5W (or more powerful) PD charger. 

If you want to use a fast charger, please make sure it's PD type.

It's also ok if you use a computer USB port for charge, it will take more time than PD charger, at about 3-6 hours. Because of computer USB port usually limit the current supply at 0.5A-1A level. Perfect explanation! Thank you",Type of Charger to Use,title prediction
"Hi! Question for the supernote team, after the holidays. 

Are any of the following features on the roadmap? (I understand the hardware roadmap is delayed for bug squashing and UI integration across devices, so it could be a while, but would love to know if they’re at least in the works or in planning.)

1. Frontlight (ability to set brightness at the least, ideally also warmth)
2. Waterproof/water resistant

3. Work with calibre wirelessly* (content server or companion app)


* actually, as I’m still having trouble getting my A5 set up to work with my PC at all via usb cable, I’m not 100% sure it works with the calibre desktop software that way. Does it? If not, that’s definitely a feature request, too.  


Thanks! Our holiday is coming to an end, but I have been on duty during the holiday

1. About the front-light.

When the E Ink screen was first put on the market, it was necessary to add an auxiliary light source due to the low contrast. However, the current contrast gets better and does not require front-light. In products whose main purpose is note-taking, removing the front-light is a common way.

However, some brands with a history of making eReaders continue to use front-light. The reason is that it can be used in places without lights, such as at night. My question is why not turn on the lamp?

Our focus is on a good handwriting experience, writing on a shiny screen will not be an enjoyable experience. 

We use the ""hard pen and soft film"" technology to simulate the effect of paper. If the front-light layer is added, the distance from the pen tip to the display layer will increase. So we would rather give up the front-light feature.

2. About waterproofing

We will not use waterproofing on the ""X"" series (A5X/A6X), but we will consider supporting waterproofing on the successor products of the ""non-X"" series

3. About USB

If you use MAC PC, you need to install the software openMTP to support USB connection. If it's not cause by this, please contact our customer service. Thanks for another quick and thorough reply. I’m consistently impressed by your presence in this subreddit.

1. I sometimes like to work and to read in bed while my spouse is asleep. That said, yes, I could leave the bedroom or perhaps use a smaller external book light. That’s a great point about adding a light lessening the writing experience.

2. Interesting, thanks!

3. It’s a laptop running Windows 10. I’ll do a bit more troubleshooting on my end and then reach out if I still can’t figure it out.

Thank you again. I enjoy this work because I like to communicate with others, especially for interesting idea to make product better. Another reason is I want to improve my English skill since I'm from the place where the mother language isn't English.

I'm happy to learn a new phrase ""reach out"" from your message.

So don't be hesitate to reach out with any question:) &gt;Our focus is on a good handwriting experience, writing on a shiny screen will not be an enjoyable experience.

I totally understand this, but the device can \*also\* be used for reading: and improving the reading experience in low light setting can be nice, don't you think so? It would also improve the perceived contrast of the screen (that's the magic behind the ""paperwhite"").

Eink screens did improve, but the background is still kinda grey. With an optimal lighting and a document with good contrast it's fine, but if that's not the case a frontlight can help. A lot. If it can be shut down, what problem would it create? Is the distance to the display layer so big that the writing experience would be really different?

"My boss was enamored enough of my A6X to buy one for herself, and for her birthday I got her a Heart of Metal pen.  She loves it, so here's a review:

""The pen is STURDY.  I don't feel like the cap is going to pop off if I drop it.  It makes a solid ""click"" when snapping it back on and I love that it's thicker than the standard pen because I prefer writing with wider barreled instruments.  It writes just as perfectly as the standard pen.  No charging required.  I don't know how long the nib will last but the packaging included easy instructions for changing it and I've had the standard for months without any degradation so I don't expect to be changing it any time soon.   Fits snugly on the case's loop and I don't worry about it coming off in my bag."" 

So obviously she gives it 5 stars, lol!  I'll be buying one for myself eventually if I get tired of the LAMY one. Totally agree; I also have the HoM pen, bought it along my A5. It solves the problem I had with my previous eink notepad; as an university student, I write a lot and the nibs would wear off way too fast. Now I can write probably till the end of the world :D So happy.

"I just got both of these delivered today I was in batch 3 for the remarkable 2

Here are my observations as a notebook doodler. I wanted a device that I could take outside and do some sketching and people studies and just generally be able to do rough logo concepts and first stage illustration layouts, like I usually do in my paper notebook. I am a biro scribbler rather than pencils so... here are my observations.

Surface feel - the biggie :) well remarkable has this won hands down. You start drawing on this and you just smile. Man it really does feel and sound like you are drawing on paper. It is absolutely incredible. The supernote definitely doesn’t feel like paper it feels like writing on rubber or a piece of Lino with a biro, as you press harder you can feel the pen almost carving into the surface. It doesn’t feel bad but it definitely doesn’t feel like paper. So if you are just looking for the most realistic paper feel then go get the remarkable 2

Drawing experience - the remarkable 2 has a large range of pens pencils and a brush. The supernote only has three  - fine liner, the pen (pressure sensitive), and the marker. The remarkable brushes all differ in the types of marks that they create and I have not yet found an absolute favourite but the brush seems very versatile lots of variation between thick and thin strokes and the biro mimics it’s real life counterpart rather well. The pencil is ok and uses tilt for shading but for some reason you can only choose one colour (black). 

Due to the smaller selection on the supernote the choice is pretty easy the pen works the best for me due to the pressure sensitivity and mimics fairly well the results that I get when I am sketching with a biro, I usually use lighter (thinner) strokes for initial forms and then lay down harder (thicker) stroke for final forms this technique also works well here. I hope that supernote include more ‘pens’ soon. I would love a brush that lets you lay down thicker strokes to make full use of the pressure sensitivity. The stylus sensitivity and lag on both are very good, perhaps the remarkable edges it here, but the supernote is very very good too.

Colours (greys) - the remarkable includes only three shades for their ‘pens’ - black, mid grey and white - with the exception of the pencil which as mentioned is only available in black. There is also a highlighter which lays down a lighter grey which is handy. It is also worth mentioning that the highlighter is translucent rather than opaque so you can still see your artwork behind it and the colour gets darker as you lay down subsequent strokes (like a real world marker pen) The supernote includes four colours for each tool - black, dark grey, light grey and white, but doesn’t include a translucent highlighter.

Erasing - where the supernote definitely outshines the remarkable 2 is in its erasing capabilities which you wouldn’t think would be a big thing, but it kinda is. I find it very difficult to see the eraser line on the remarkable and you only see what you have erased when you finish your stroke, so you’re never quite sure what the result is going to be, there seems to be quite a bit of trial and error as to how much of the stroke is erased, which is annoying if you are trying to erase precisely for highlights etc. If you are just using one layer then you can ‘erase’ using a white colour for any of the pens, but if you want to put a shadow layer beneath your main artwork then it kinda messes everything up because you have white opaque ink on the layer above. Supernote on the other hand nails this, the eraser works the same as the brushes, it erases instantly so you can be very precise. Obviously in real life you don’t have multiple layers in your paper notebook but thought it was worth mentioning.

Screen refresh - the remarkable leaves quite noticeable ghosting behind on darker inked areas when you close the tool sub palettes, and I don’t think it’s possible to do a manual screen refresh, although switching a layer visibility off and on seems to do the trick. I haven’t encountered these issues on the supernote but if I did you can swipe up on the sidebar to refresh the screen which is nice.

Size and portability - the remarkable is about the same size as an A4 piece of paper. So the equivalent of an open a5 notepad which is what I usually have in front of me in front of my keyboard when I’m working, so it’s a nice size, to scribble down some sketches or client notes when at work. The supernote may be a little small to jot down a lot of notes or sketches and it is not currently possible to zoom in to the canvas, but is absolutely ideal to pop in your bag and do some al fresco doodling. Another thing to note is that the remarkable 2 has a landscape mode but the supernote doesn’t. So if you are drawing in landscape orientation the toolbar is rotated 90 degrees

Overall feel - I preordered my remarkable 2 and just got the vanilla options so standard pen and sleeve only. So that cost around USD399 plus shipping The supernote a6x was USD 369 plus shipping but the real kick in the pants was the 20% extra you pay on import taxes. So these two devices were practically the same price. 

But when you handle them the remarkable feels like a luxury item and the supernote feels like a fun friendly gadget. I wouldn’t think twice about throwing the supernote in my bag and whipping it out to do some urban sketching, but the remarkable 2 feels a lot more precious and feels like it would be a lot more conspicuous in public places

From a pure sketching point of view it’s difficult to choose between the two. The pen performance on both is equally as good. The sheer size and paper feel make the remarkable great for cracking out development sketches and making  longer form notes at home or the office. The only thing putting a dampener on the experience is the eraser functionality. The size of the supernote makes it very portable and great for urban sketching, single sketches, and shorter notes/lists.

I’m enjoying them both and not sure which will get most use but I have a feeling that I’ll take the supernote everywhere with me, and use the remarkable primarily at my desk or on the sofa.

In summary

Remarkable 2

===========

\+ feels like writing on paper

\+ Premium feeling/looking product

\+ Pen performance is great

\+ Landscape mode

Eraser isn’t very good

Some screen refresh artefacts

Maybe a little conspicuous for urban sketching

Supernote a6x

===========

\+ Great size for urban sketching

\+ Free folio cover and pen

\+ Pen performance is great

\+ More shades of grey to choose from

\+ Eraser works well

Feels like biro on rubber not paper

Fewer tool to choose from

No zoom

No landscape mode

Maybe too small for development sketches or extensive notes

Hope that helps any doodlers out there Thank you for bringing a so fair and so detailed comparison.

After I read it carefully, I will follow your article from the role of product participant. This is such a great review. Very detailed. I especially agree with you on the size of the A6x. I find myself bringing it everywhere with me because of its size. Great review!

Another point I notice about the Supernote. The bottom end of the pressure curve has no opacity pressure. Only size. So the stroke gets smaller, and then just stops at a certain pressure activation.

On Remarkable, a light touch with the pen has a slight opacity falloff, like a real pen. The pencil even more so. So you can get a lighter half-textured stroke.

But even the Remarkable pen pressure curve doesn’t go to zero. It snaps off at a certain pressure. So if you try and draw an extremely light line, it snaps on and off like a dashed line.

I’d love if both these tablets had a complete drop off to zero on the pressure curve. It would make drawing much better. But with Remarkable, it has a slight edge because it has a bit of opacity falloff too.

Both feel nice though, and I enjoy drawing and writing on both.

Also, sometimes I use the Remarkable stylus on the Supernote. The plastic nib glides very nicely over the rubbery surface! And the stylus is lighter than the Heart of Metal stylus, so it’s a bit easier on my wrist after a while.  Supernote was originally designed for note-taking, so we made HoM into the same shape and weight as a traditional pen.

But when it comes to art, the lighter the better. So we're going to make a special pencil for the artist. It can also be used in other situations. And compatible with all Supernote tablets. This pen will be the default accessory for A5 SLIM, but users can purchase it separately.

"I haven't ordered an A6X yet,  was really hoping for an A5X soon.  I was wondering it anyone is able to test the Trello app for functionality and if it doesn't work is life to put in s request for it. Hello, thank you for your information, we have recorded your request. Could you please describe your use case? I am an engineering consultant. I create buckets for each of my clients and then create cards for each project I'm working on. Inside the cards I add notes from calls, task lists, setup a timeline that gets added to a calendar, etc. Once a project is done I will move the card to Client-Archive bucket. I would suggest you look at getting a regular tablet, like an iPad with a paperly screen protector instead to get a paper-like feel. I don't think this device or other eInk devices can properly support that work flow.

If you want just a Kanban board I'd understand. You could definitely draw up a Kanban template. But a fully functional Trello is excessive for these types of devices. 

Additionally, Trello doesn't support handwriting, so you would be typing everything out anyways, which will be a way slower experience due to eInk. 

Take Onyx Boox for example. They just use fully open android so you can install anything you want. But the performance of the app won't be any good for it. Since they have no control over a third party-apps, nothing can be done other than wait for an upgraded model that can handle it.

"After updating to the most recent A5 software here are some of my thoughts about the changes made to the top menu bar for note taking.

Moving the page number display position in notes to the top menu bar to prevent accidental touches was a definite improvement for my daily workflow. However I feel that the user interface design of the top menu bar still needs a bit more refinement, as I have now lost easy access to a lot of my regularly used menu items such as share &amp; export, templates, and quick access.

I think too much unnecessary space is being taken up by the note/document title (50% or more of the screen width) and the page navigation. By reducing the size of the space and decreasing the font size of the text for the titles, I think at least 3 or 4 of the other more commonly used menu items can be restored to the primary top menu instead of being relegated to the secondary drop down menu list instead.

Curious to know others opinions on the new top menu redesign for the A5. Which menu items do you often use that are now part of the secondary menu options (ooo)? 

Is there any way to customise which menu items are more important for inclusion in the primary top menu by prioritising the items in the same way that tag menu items are ordered in the settings menu?

As always thanks for the regular updates and feedback on questions and issues posted by users. Malcsweb, have you tried to simply double tap anywhere on the screen to hide all menus?  This gives you full screen real a state for writing or document viewing. Thanks but the issue is not about trying to hide menus for writing/reading but suggesting to get rid of empty white space in the title and page navigation section of the NEW top menu to make room for more menu options that used to be there previously. Thank you for your thoughts, this is very helpful. What do you think about the user interaction design of the A6 X? We have piloted a new user interface on the A6 X. The top menu has been redesigned based on the frequency with which users access different menu items. We are still working on this interface and plan to unify the A5, A6 Agile and A6 X once it is complete. Thanks Supernote\_official. Haven't seen the A6X design in detail but from what you described I like the idea of top menu items based on frequency of use. Look forward to seeing this feature in future updates.

1. I have never used the Kindle app before and I don t quite understand it.

I also find out that you can buy kindle books for 3rd party shops. I am not interested in the market aspect of it, because there are not many books in my language on their platform, but is there a reason to choose the kindle library over the default Supernote library (the tablet's interface itself)?

2. I just found out about the titling feature of the tablet, but can I use it for PDF s text (lasso -&gt; transform into title)? If not, how could I insert titles that could be recognized by the tablet if we are talking about a PDF that I created? 

3. Because I didn t find a solution to the .2 question, I am using bookmarks. Can i change the ""title"" of the bookmark? Long press doesn t work.

4. I just saw that .word format is available (I don t know if it was available before) and that a lot of functions were implemented for it, especially the zoom function. I was quite sad that I can t zoom in my PDFs, but I found out about the trimming feature for the PDFs files. This is like a zoom, right? Does it have another function?

1. kindle app is used to read the ebooks only from kindle store. 

2. We support the handwriting title to make the note file structured and indexable. because many user's note increased to dozens of pages, they need a easy way locate the page quickly. We will not support this feature on PDF/DOC. Because PDF/DOC has own methods such as cross-reference, you can jump to the page from the cross-reference.

"Just following up with a question I saw someone else had. A major use case for me to buy into an e-ink note taking device is to be able to skip a step when taking notes. The conversion of my handwritten notes to text that I can eventually turn into more coherent documents. Is handwriting to text in the pipeline for implementation? It's a fashion. But according to our test, handwriting recognition will limit the fun and freedom of notes, and even slow down the writing speed (in order to ensure the recognition rate). So we will support this feature, but the priority is not high. And handwriting recognition will first be applied in some partial features, such as keyword recognition, and the text insertion in the doc revision function that will be released in the next update. The function of ""entire handwriting recognition and import into DOC/TXT"" will be implemented at the end.

This is not a technical problem, but a difference in product concepts. That's good to know it is something that can be implemented. Thank you for actually responding, even if I am disappointed in the answer.

But wouldn't that improve the functionality and fun of a note taking device? I don't think it has to be done simultaneously, but if I'm using the supernote  to take notes during an interview, a meeting, or a lecture, which seems like a pretty common use-case, it would so helpful to be able to export my handwritten notes afterwards into a text document. I don't think it has to be live. It could even be something you schedule to do when the device isn't being used. It would add a practical element to something that is fun! 

For example. As part of an ideation process, I could be brainstorming something on my device, have it exported to an md, docx, or txt file, share with a colleague for feedback, and then I could review/annotate it back on my device. It would just eliminate a step of doing a manual conversion!

If it isn't a technical problem, you could implement it in a way that fits with your intentions for the devices. But if Nova and other note-taking eink/tablet can do it, its a bit unfortunate this one chooses not to. Especially when your devices seem to offer such good features in other ways! It seems like the devices are so close to what I want, and I may still buy one, but not having this available in the foreseeable future is a reason not to jump in, yet.

Either way, thanks again for replying and being transparent, even if I don't agree. Until I can justify a device, I wish the team continued success! If you output TXT/DOC in a calm environment, you will find the keyboard is the most efficient.  If you take notes in interviews or meetings, you will find that your writing needs to keep up with other people's speeches, which leads to scribbling.  Some sketches are even mixed in to make the description more intuitive.  These all increase the difficulty of identification.  If you have really used similar software, you will find that the effect may not be as good as you think.  We are not opposed to full text recognition.  We just tend to accumulate some assistive technology and then do this.  For example, how to distinguish between sketches and characters. Because once we start to do this, we must ensure that it is really effective, not just a marketing video in an ideal state. Yes indeed a keyboard would be more efficient, but for many reasons, not always viable. Hence a note-taking device can fill the need. It's good point that hand notes tend to also include sketches or special characters, like those in mathematical equations or flow charts or cluster maps. It is reassuring that it seems that there is a focus on delivering a clever bit of software as the goal. However, you did say earlier that it wasn't technically difficult. So now I'm confused.

Either way, it seems this functionality will be added, perhaps more in the future, but when it does, I think your software and products will become a lot more attractive to people like me, or academics, analysts, jotters, or creatives. The original point of my question was whether it was in the roadmap of functionality. I'm glad to see it is, disappointed it isn't as much of a priority, so now I'm hoping that when it does become a feature, that it was worth the wait",Handwriting to text,title prediction
"Hello guys! I'm wondering if A6X can handle pdfs (scanned books) well. I'm a bit worried about the screen size. I heard there's crop function but is that enough to read small texts?

How's your experience?

(p.s. eagerly waiting for the A5X) I am reading now on some material that I wrote in Times New Roman 12, double spaced, and with the crop function it s good. It was readable even without the crop function (I discovered it later).

The only part that I don t like about the crop function is the fact that it takes the ""note space"" away, but I believe you can ""\[ \]"" and make notes inside that - look into the user manual for this. 0:46 - PDF articles.

"It would be wonderful to be able to borrow free ebooks from my public library right from A5. I know other linux based e-reader devices can do this, e.g. Kobo.  I wonder if other A5 users would like this feature?  And....Is there any chance that Ratta engineers can integrate Overdrive or Libby into the A5 platform. OverDrive seems only support  ios/android. So you may get other resource, such as gutenberg project.  [https://www.gutenberg.org/](https://www.gutenberg.org/)  You may download the ebooks from the website and than transfer to your A5. Thank you hex2asc.  I appreciate your prompt reply.  I will try this.  

But, please allow me to ask another question.  I am not a programmer, so my knowledge is very limited in this area.  And I probably don’t know that I don’t know.   Nevertheless, when I was researching e-ink tablets, I selected the A5 because of the stability of Linux OS, which runs my wonderful A5.  I understand that Kobo e-readers also run on Linux.  How can they incorporate Overdrive, and not the A5 if hey are both on the same platform?  Is it because e-readers are fundamentally different from e-ink tablets? You like to ask why, which makes me have to check the usage of OverDrive.

I found that Kobo has developed an interface specifically for OverDrive, so Kobo can directly connect to OverDrive to browse and read eBooks. But for other eReaders, there will be some complexity, Users need to install the software ADE (Adobe Digital Editions) on PC/Mac . We can to vist the OverDrive website by PC browser, and then download the eBook, and then transfer the book to the e-reader.

We have not tried to connect to ADE,  we will learn more and try. I am grateful that you looked into it and even considering the request.  Best wishes.",Feature request: Overdrive on the the Linux A5 platform.,title prediction
"Is A6X more abrasive than Oynx on the pen? If I use the same pen (Lamy Al Star) on both of them, will the nib wear be the same? I am not sure about the nib wear, but i believe the nib you would use on both devices are different. Due to the surface coating on the A6X, the nib is harder compare to the nib you would use for Onyx.  


So if you do reuse a pen between the two devices, you would have to swap nibs before using. Thanks for the answer. Is it possible just to buy the nib for A6X from somewhere? Supernote devices have a built in screen protector that is much more pliable than Onyx (or any other e ink device).  The pen that comes with Supernote devices has a ceramic tip that never needs to be replaced.  It can only be used with Supernote devices - if you use it on any other type of device it will scratch the surface.

You can also get an upgraded package from Supernote that includes a Lamy Al Star EMR.  The nib on that is plastic and will need to be replaced.  Because the Supernote screen is more pliable than other devices, it's possible that nibs will last longer when used on that device versus other ones.

I purchased the A6X with the stock pen (ceramic nib) and it works great.  I also have a Lamy - but I use reMarkable nibs in it.  The stock Lamy nib on the Supernote felt too slippery.  The reMarkable nibs work great and have a better writing feel in my opinion.

I also have the Noris Digital Jumbo, and absolutely love the writing feel of that on the A6X.  I usually switch between the Noris and Lamy because I love both of them.

Based on a recent video from Voja ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgj5Y7NHY74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgj5Y7NHY74)) about the best pen and nib combinations for e ink devices, I have ordered the Samsung Tab S6 Lite pen and  HP ZBOOK X2 nibs.  Can't wait for those to come in.  On a side note, I also can't wait to order an A5X :D I had an Onyx Boox Max 3 and sent it back. Now I have a Supernote A6X. The A6X is far better than the Max 3 for the writing feel with the Lamy pen (with lamy standard nibs). The Supernote Pen is better than the Boox pen too.

"I use the Scribd app for ebooks and audiobooks. It is a service that is dying for an ereader but alas there isn't one. A partnership between Scribd and Supernote would be innovative! Copy that. Partnerships are both good and bad. How many devices do we  buy with preloaded applications we never wanted and can never get rid of? 

Is okay to offer it, but also allow the customer to delete it. The last thing Supernote needs is a application to Scribd that can never be removed by the customer.

Example, I dislike Facebook and never use it. But I can't uninstall it from my Samsung Note 9. I can turn it off, but it's always there. Very good points, I totally agree. I agree. I like the Kindle app on Supernote A6X - it works great on the e-ink screen and provides an option to read purchased books on an already excellent note taking device.

Having Scribd would provide a 'Netflix for books' like option to supplement Kindle's traditional book buying option and, for me, would complete the e-ink device experience.

I agree with another poster that too many apps would be cumbersome and detract from Supernote's streamlined user experience. If someone wants unlimited flexibility to download apps, Likebook and Onyx are options. I'm happy they picked Kindle and stuck with it instead of adding Kobo and Play Books and all the other alternatives. (I'd similarly be fine if they had picked a different store front - too many choices weigh down the user interface. Better to have one and stick with it.)

"Would it be possible to have a tools menu accessible in full screen mode? I like full screen for writing, but it is annoying to have to exit full screen to pull up the tool bar. Yes, a floating tool bar/bubble is comming in near update. Any chance of getting the A5 functionality of double tapping to go in and out of full screen? In the early design, we used a lot of hidden interactive functions. For example, double-click to enter/exit the full screen. Swipe from the side to the center of the screen to call the writing toolbar. Long press the file name to enter file delete/move/copy operations, etc. These designs make the interface more concise, but also cause some side effects. Most users will not read the user manual carefully (of course I do too), and they will complain if they don't know what to do. So in the later design, we try to avoid hiding functions, but it may be overkill.

" I know the Ratta team has a lot on their plates but hopefully this is something that can  be addressed in future software updates. I think both the rM and Supernote look as unclean as they do because of how note-taking on the devices themselves is the main selling point, and so to the creators of these eNote devices, export comes after that. Not saying that the exports should not look crisp, but it bears repeating what the primary intention of each device is to help understand where these young products stand. As for whether or not they're dealbreakers is up to the consumer.

In addition, Onyx Boox products tend to be somewhere in-between eNote and a full-blown eInk Android device, which is why they have the best of both worlds for software.

"After searching high and low, did you know, not a single note taking device or application offers hand recognition spelling checking. Not a single one.

If the device or application can do OCR for hand writing, then it could also spell check too. Normally OCR keeps some index of the words written to search against. That index could also be scanned against a dictionary. If the word is not found in the dictionary, the device or application could highlight or tag the word as misspelled. It's up to the developers of the tool offers spelling options or corrections.

I've put the same challenge to Goodnotes application team for the iPad. As I said, no one offers this feature yet. 

So depending if Supernote or Goodnotes implements first, then that's what I'm going with. My needs are simple, OCR for text search and spell checking. I posted before I finished. For OCR the possibilities really multiply. With standard text you can offer translation services.

Also, some people love writing notes, but they don't like their handwriting. So if you introduced OCR with font replacement, you can help those folks make beautiful notes. Write a word, and OCR picks up the word, and then replaces the word with nice font

Ratta might think of selling add-ons too. So everything I mentioned could be an additional extra folks could buy /unlock. No different that Goodnotes / Notability or other note taking apps.

If the difference between having full OCR with search and spelling check is extra $40, then that is worth it to me.

I hate subscriptions though. Have you checked out MyScript Nebo? I use it for long form writing (just straight up writing text, no drawings). It's on android and iOS and can convert your handwriting to text as you write. Just double-tap to convert. And it's easy to edit the text that's already been converted. Your handwriting style does not get saved. 

It can then export the text to different formats or other apps. I like to use it with Day One which is awesome for journaling. 

Doing long form writing on the Supernote feels like a lot of handwritten text that I have to review and type out if I want to make any good use of it. We have 3 goals

1 Make the note orgnized by original handwriting titles that can help user locate the page quickly. like ""table of contents"" of MS DocX.  Without any recognition. This is more free, you can set anything as titile, words, symbols,etc...

2 Can modify the DocX by handwriting. 

3 Can recogination entie page of handwring smartly(Able to distinguish between text and sketches) and output to Text/MarkDown/DocX.

"I was wondering if Supernote has any plans to support RemNote in X series (as RemNote is available as an android app) (see \[1\] below for further details on RemNote).

I think it would be quite useful to have an advanced note-management app (like RemNote, Obsidian, Roam research, Insight, etc) available in supernote directly; among these, RemNote is free and has an android app (btw I'm not affiliated with RemNote or anything, I just find it extremely efficient. See \[2\] for my use case).

I'm not sure whether this is a niche use case or whether there are a lot of supernote esers who would use this if it was available, so I'd appreciate if the community chimes in. Also, I'm tagging u/hex2asc : I'd appreciate if the Chief Chat Officer informs us to if there is any such plan :)  
\------

\[1\] For those who do not know, RemNote is a ""note-taking"" platform/app. It uses science-backed methods to ensure efficient learning (such as spaced-repetition, bi-directional linking, flashcards, etc).   Please see [https://www.remnote.io](https://www.remnote.io) for further details. There are several such platforms (RemNote in my opinion is most balakned, and is also free), for a nice comparison see these youtube videos [https://youtu.be/M2U61vHfQSQ](https://youtu.be/M2U61vHfQSQ) , [https://youtu.be/opSENgc45Sw](https://youtu.be/opSENgc45Sw) .

\[2\] I'm a PhD student in physics, and I use RemNote regularly to take both my academic notes and my daily scribbles . I  do not own a supernote right now, but I'll be buying a5x ---actually I would buy it right now while it is discounted but unfortunately I'm currently not in US and will not be back till the end of next month. I plan to use supernote to read papers (mostly arxiv stuff). I would definitely use this if it were available. I am not sure how feasible it would be though without the addition of an external keyboard. Part of the beauty of Remnote is how quickly one can enter and arrange data with keyboard shortcuts. But maybe I'm just too used to using it on my laptop to envision a new implementation.

Now, if only there were a way to have all of Remnote's features in a handwriting app then I would be in pure bliss. 🤗 I have to admin that I don't know RemNote or similar types of tools.  
My question here is how much RemNote needs web connection and ""intelligence"" from other places to organize/restructure information.

I think one of the main positive features of Supernote is that is focused on note taking, it can be used offline and you can choose when you need to go online or USB-connect to transfer/synchronise your stuff.  
To be too much dependent on external engines or tools (if this is something RemNOte requires) is not something I see as a positive path for Supernote, but of course this is a personal and quite limited point of view from myself :-) The poor CCO does not know much.

"Hi, I see with pleasure that Supernote is working hard to support editing functionalities for digital formats (i.e. Word .docx).

I have to admit that I'm not using them a lot now, but I'd like to ask here why the .docx format and if Supernote is planning to have a more general and standard approach to this.

Word is a proprietary tool and .docx is a not-so-great standard for text document (I don't use MSOffice and I use the standard .odt format, supported by LibreOffice, OpenOffice... for text documents).

What I'm thinking is whether simpler plain text formats could be supported as a more standard and interoperable basis to transform digital notes.  
I think that simple .txt files would be the first step, but an open and widely implemented and supported structured text format as Markdown ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)) would be an ideal solution.

I can see (dreaming) simple signs (short line or asterisks) for writing bullet points or identifying headers in the notes or ways to reference other notes (internal links). You already have some functions transforming manual input into structured commands (e.g. the square brackets or the stars for notes, the insert or flip command in the Word files) so it seems to me a natural evolution for more advanced functions.

I think that having a plain text format like Markdown supported could allow to have multiple types of export from it (.docx, .odt, .rst, simple .txt) and it can be well connected also with (future implementations of?) text recognition and transformation from manual notes to structured text.

Anyway, this is just food for thought... :-)

Ale I would personally love that feature! I do remember reading on this reddit that Mzrkdown support is planned. Text and MarkDown will be support. It’s in plan.

I find them both very comfortable to hold. The Lamy might be better for controlling the pen when trying to do precise work and it's lighter than the Heart of Metal. However, it probably comes down to personal preference. If you have access to a regular Lamy pen, the experience will be similar if you want to test it against a typical metal executive type pen that the Heart of Metal emulates.

The ceramic nib on the new Heart of Metal pens ensures that you won't have to worry about replacing nibs as they wear out. 

Personally, I like them both and alternate between them. The Lamy will also work on other EMR enabled screens like some Chromebooks and tablets. The ceramic nib on the Heart of Metal is hard so shouldn't be used with a device other than the supernote.

If you do a fair bit of drawing, then the Lamy might be the better pick. If you mostly take notes, I think that the Heart of Metal has the overall edge. I watched your guide and thought it was very good. I've watched many of your in-depth reviews and rely on them for choosing e-ink devices.

I would comment that I was surprised at the lower rating for Precision that you gave the Lamy (7/10) - not a bad rating - but in my experience, I found its precision to be very good and more comparable to the top of the group.

I was also surprised at the higher rating for the Samsung. It's a better pen than the standard Boox, but I didn't see it as anything special - too thin for my taste, round unlike the Staedler, and I didn't like the feel of the soft nib at all.

Otherwise, I agree with your ratings. 

Thanks for the guide! Thank you! You've been very helpful!",Difference between AL-star EMR and the other styluses,title prediction
"Hello all
I just figured out some of the basic yet powerful features needed on the the Supernote devices.

The pdf experience on the supernote is not bad, but some of  functionalities on it would make it great for any kind of document format...

1. Landscape mode for pdf documents.
2. Crop Features including the article mode support 
3. Gesture for bringing up the table of contents.
4. Insert clipart / image while taking notes.
5. Pinch to zoom in and out the content.

These features would make even the smaller A6x fully functional.

2. I will forward it to PM.
3. In kindle device, we can tap the top area to call the TOC. But in Supernote, we must filter the tap when writing. So can we call the TOC from sidebar?
4. In plan, but not start
5. Is developing. Awesome...
Thank you for the kind response
Really love the device and the writing feel on it
But yeah some times I feel adding functionalities would make the device even more better...

Looks like a lot of new features are on the map and really looking forward to see them on my A6X.

Reg.2 I mean TOC while reading pdf textbooks and not on the notes app.
And yeah if it is possible to call the TOC through the sidebar it would be handy and neat.
I have some ideas but not sure if it is possible to implement them on the device.
1. In a document -&gt; In the full screen mode (I mean *only when double tapped on a document to get rid of all the UI elements) - the sidebar when swiped up  instead of showing the regular app navigation menus it would be great if it shows TOC and as uasual manual refresh when swiped down. 
On exit (I mean again double tap) brings everything to the normal way as usual as it is at the moment...
(OR)
Atleast an option to manually set what the swipe up side bar does in which TOC is an option.

2. Two finger swipe on screen from left to right to bring up the TOC in a box covering half the screen is also an option...",Manditory Functionalities needed on the Supernote devices,title prediction
"I really like how responsive and supportive the Supernote team is, especially on Reddit. It's great to see they consider the user experience and feedback. A little while ago someone posted something and a rep from the team made a comment like 'we hadn't thought of that, it's an interesting idea'. I think this type of feedback system is great!

However, I feel a lot of people post on this sub with a kind of 'all or nothing' slant - like if 'Supernote doesn't do X, then I'm not buying!' It""s fine, it's a forum, it's up to you to make your line in the sand somewhere. But, why are some people writing so absolutely? I think if we have feedback or suggestions, it would probably be most effective written with examples or justification or use-case scenarios. I know I'd be more inclined to listen to well-explained ideas rather than ultimatums. 

Alas, just some boxing day venting. Cheers y'all You should see r/remarkabletablet if you think this is bad... Not comparable.
Remarkable support does not respond, it is normal that ppl go absolute in that case. Supernote read every single line and answers.
The point is not ""it is bad"", the point is ""it has no sense to write with this tone."", as far as I understand. Yeah, in general I agree. A lot of people are kinda taking the teams responsiveness for granted.

Here are just a few examples:  

* ""I've put the same challenge to Goodnotes application team..."" ""My needs are simple""
* ""Mandatory functionalities needed""
* ""Why are you not supporting""

As much as I love the teams responsiveness, I do feel some people have been quite harsh in their wording when making requests.

Personally I'd rather the team improve what they already have, before adding more work to their plate and bloating the system. I've always seen Supernote to be a minimalist alternative to other devices simply for ""note-taking"".

I guess some people want stuff with all the bells &amp; whistles like:

* E-reader with pdfs, news, books, and probably even websites.
* E-writer with every single text format.

Which is pretty much the Onyx Boox. Which is not minimalist or lightweight. I'd personally rather a tool that does one job, and one job well. To jump off of the last sentence:

As useful as the kindle update is, I'm very excited for the improvements they're making with their native writing software (e.g. pencil brush and Word editing). They're consistently refining the ""mobile office"" idea with each update, and I'm glad to see that they take the time to put in additional stuff but only as secondary or supportive of the ""mobile office"" theme. Hopefully in the next update or the one after it, they have some improvements for the native pdf reader for markup and export.

"I had my A6x for a few months now, but today was the first time I had to transfer some files to it from my phone.  I tried to pair it, but I keep getting nowhere.  I tried initiating pairing from the phone and A6x with same results.

Basically the two devices see each other, both pop up a pin screen and both have a pair button.  When I click pair button on A6x a keyboard pops up, which I assume is to enter the pin.  When I enter the pin it kicks me back out of the bluetooth settings screen. The two appear to be briefly connected, but then connection is lost.  Any clue what's going on.

If it matters I have a Google Pixel 4 that works fine with my other bluetooth devices. We think that the Bluetooth transmission rate is low, so we did not use it to transfer files. And only use it to support Bluetooth keyboards and Bluetooth speakers. It will failed to connect to other devices. But we should give tips for other connections that are not supported. Clear information should be given instead of letting users guess what happened. This is our mistake. We will fix it as soon as possible.

If you transfer files from a mobile phone, it is recommended to use cloud synchronization. You can use Supernote Cloud or Dropbox. You can also use Wifi-Direct to transmit directly (it needs to be on the same WIFI network, sometimes it is not stable). Both of these methods require you to install the Supernote Parter App or Dropbox App on your phone. Is there any update on the super note app not functioning for the last few months?

1) How long does it take to ship? I live in California.

2) Is there a desktop app? If so, can I create a note in the desktop app or is it simply importing/exporting? The reason I ask is because my work prevents me from using cloud services due to security reasons. I was hoping I could import screenshots from my work computer and place it in a note on the A6X via USB.

3) How frequent are you guys recharging your device?

TIA!! Hello.

1. About the ship... It took me 7 days aprox to come to Spain. But I paid €150 of taxes...
2. Nope. Only the Browser version of supernote's app. But you can configure dropbox. The only problem is you cannot see notes in dropbox. You must export first to PDF or JPG from your A6X.
3. It depends, it can last 1 week if you use it for hours. For me is about 2 - 3 weeks of light use because I'm not that busy right now.

Anytime! 1) West Coast here. Bought it on Christmas, got shipped on the 28th, and received it on the 31st. So 3 or 6 days, depending on how you measure it.

3) I charged it once in the time I've had it, though it's about to need another one. 2. I find even though I sync to Dropbox, I don’t review my notes on devices other than the Supernote itself.

"Hi! A very happy user of A6X here. I had a feature request. 

Currently the name of a new note is basically the timestamp without spaces. I do want dates as the name of the notes, but I would like the option to make it more readable so I don't have to change it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason and explanation:

* I find using the keyboard and renaming a notes doc every time I create one tedious, and the current timestamp one is not as readable
* Mostly I end up just adding spaces/dashes to make it more like yyyy-MM-dd-timstamp format, so would be great if say the device could give option what the default name is. 
   * Some options could be
      * yyyy-MM-dd &lt;day of week&gt; i.e. 2021-01-05 Tuesday
      * yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss i.e. 2021-01-05 12:00:00
      * yyyy MMM dd i.e. 2021 Jan 05
      * and many more
   * In case of duplicates, the notes can always append (count) to differentiate. Eg: ""2021-01-05 (1)"" if another file with the same name exists After seeing your suggestion, I immediately understood why I always thought the default file name was strange before.

"Hey... Just ordered A5X and have a few questions.

I have a sizeable Zotero library 6000+ pdfs that I currently sync to my BOOX via Google drive and an app (autosync). This works pretty well as Zotero automatically names the pdf files with author-year-title, and search is quick enough on BOOX to bring up the thing I need in a couple of seconds. I can then annotate and save, the annotated version gets automatically synced back to my laptop.

What I want to know is - does dropbox sync on Supernote automatically keep in sync? How well will Supernote handle that many PDFs in terms of search speed? And, will annotations be backed up straight to Dropbox/laptop?

Cheers! How are you using Zotero as a pdf library? :O Annotations are backed up to drop box as a separate .mark file. So you’ll have the original unedited .pdf, plus a .mark with annotations. 

You have to export or use the supernote companion app if you want new pdfs that have the annotations integrated. Zotero works really well to organise pdfs - you can drag/drop a pdf onto the main window and it will usually find the metadata for it (better than other reference managers I've used). The trick for getting pdfs easily available on mobile is to use the extension 'zotfile' which will rename the pdf and move it from Zotero's own labyrinth directory structure into one big directory that you can sync with Google Drive/Dropbox. Also, the browser addon for Zotero is great for taking html snapshots of webpages - these come out really well on Boox devices (I don't know about other ereaders) as text-resizable books.

The annoyance on Boox (as with Android tablets/phones) is there is no way to push changes to the Google drive folder to the device, so you have to use a third party app that you manually sync or set it to look at time intervals. This works, but just not very efficient.

There is an android app - zoo for zotero - that's really well made and can link to the synced folder to open pdf attachments. The problem is that when you have a lot of pdfs it can be very slow to open the pdf. Maybe down the line a version for Supernote could be great. Ah, thanks for the info. That should work fine for my needs. In some ways it is better to keep the version in my Zotero library clean from my scribbles anyway and it is good to have a separate place for marked up versions to know what's been read, maybe.","Zotero, Dropbox sync and search capabilities A5X",title prediction

an Idea I had, since kindle is its own aplication would be adding a small memo pad on the top pull down menu, that way taking quick notes from kindle (or any future apps might be possible) within the app. I dont know how feasible it is to make the app and note function work at the same time.

another thing I was thinking which I dont know if it is already a setting or not since I could not find it, is displaying the residence or contact info at the lock screen, in the case the tablet gets lost.

currently If I loose my device, whoever finds it would need to unlock it, go to the menu, find account information and then contact me.

"Hi Supernoters, I have a question.  

I am on the A5.  I have a note page that I use to document and track my billable hours for consulting services.  For ease of documentation of my consulting hours, I linked this page under [Quick access].  That note file now is now 37 pages long, and grows weekly.  Every time I go to [Quick access] and open this this note file, it opens by default to the first page.  I then have to jump to the last page to add new hours.  Is there a way to have Supernote to open (by default) the last page that was opened?  Has someone found a workaround?  If not, then can the last paged opened in a note page be the default when accessing a note file from [Quick access]?

Thanks Tats a neat idea. Could definitely see how that is useful. On drawboard there is a little symbol that lets you jump back to the start of the previous  'timestamp' like when you first started a chapter or something. It would be cool to have Great suggestion.

"Hello Supernote,

I’ve pre-ordered the 5x and am excited to start using it!  I’ve been watching videos on it and noticed you changed the ‘create’ button so that instead of instantly creating a new note, you now have to choose whether you want to add a note or a Word document. 

I think many of us will rarely (if ever) create a Word document as we have purchased this device primarily for making hand written notes. 

Can you please either move the Word document creation to another location, or only show that option after a long tap-and-hold, etc. so that a regular tap on the ‘plus’ icon will simply create a note?

I plan to create dozens of notes per day so this would make the experience much more pleasant. 

Thanks for considering. Agreed Your suggestion make sense. We will change it soon.

Thank you very much. Thanks very much! Agreed too!! I dont really need the word document creation function so readily. Perhaps place that option in the document folder? Thanks so much to the supernote team! I feel theyve been so innovative :)",Return to single-tap note creation,title prediction
"Hi everyone,

1.  I saw something posted here a while ago about choosing a server, but I can no longer find it.  I created my account on the Supernote A5x and enabled sync.  Upon logging into the cloud in my browser I accidentally clicked the China location, not realizing I couldnt switch afterwards.  Is there any way to switch server location after the fact?  Is there an option on the physical device I may not be seeing?

2.  I was testing things out, creating notes and playing around with the features.  I hit the sync button to upload what I have, went to the server website, and all I can see are the folders Ive created.  No notes show up at all, only the one screenshot I took.  Any information on this?

3.  Is there an export/save as pdf option yet?  I saw the post from a while back that it was coming but I havent seen any updates on it so far.

Thanks in advance for any help! Re. 1, paging /u/hex2asc.

For 2, have you actually selected the folders you want to sync? It doesn't default to syncing anything and might just be showing you a skeleton directory structure.

For 3, hit the 3 dots -&gt; Export -&gt; PDF, or do you mean proper vector export? For 2.  How do I select which folders to sync?  Long press, check them, then hit sync from the drop down?

3.  I figured that one out, just what I needed it to do.  Edited my original post.

Thank you for your help! So you need to go back into settings, go into sync, and click the right arrow to choose folders. You can choose a folder by checking it or enter the folder by tapping it (say you only want to sync a subdirectory -- as an example, I sync a directory called Personal but not Work).

If the folder chooser doesn't show up, it's a software glitch -- rebooting (in the settings too) will fix it. I see the arrow, and all of my folders are checked off",Questions about syncing and other things.,title prediction

"Hey, so I'm upgrading my trusty old kindle keyboard ereader and I really really like the look of the supernote devices. They just look much nicer than boox in my opinion. I love the aesthetic, the nicer pens, the nicer cases etc.

One of the huge reasons to upgrade my old kindle is to get a Glow light. At the moment I use a clip on light that is a faff. I know supernote devices currently don't have lights but will they in the future? Is it worth me waiting to see if they get one?

My second question is will super note support apps/apks so I can borrow books from my local library? Here in the UK most library's use BorrowBox which has an Android app. The second most popular library app is Libby. Will Supernote make these two apps available?

Thanks Very much doubt they'll ever have a light, it requires more space between the pen and the screen which makes writing feel funny. I think it's unlikely you'll see such niche apps supported but I don't know their full plans with regards to app support. It kinda seems like you're looking for a different device than what supernote is trying to be, the target is note taking as a top priority. Yeah fair enough, thanks for the feedback. I'm also an app developer and would love to make some eink friendly apps so I guess the boox or likebook devices are the ones for me. I just thought the supernote looked so much nicer! I saw an old comment of a user that suggested a folio with an integrated light. That would be a perfect solution in my opinion.
You have it if you want to, don't have it if you don't want. While waiting for mine to arrive I've been thinking about some of the things I'd like to see added (like Libby/Overdrive)... but I'm also thinking about how difficult the Ratta situation is.

"From what I have understood there is no charger shipped with the device.  
I wanted to ask the following  
a)Does the supernote support fast chargers  
b)What type of chargers does Ratta recommend for the supernote? I mean how many Amphere Here's a comment from hex2asc on A6X charge:
&gt; A6X support USBPD (the main fast charge standard). It's a negotiation protocol. When plugged, the charger will ask A6X, ""how much current you want?"", and A6X always answer,""1.5A is enough"". So the charger will start supply current limited by the agreement. You need not worry about too much current would damage the device. Typically A6X will get full charged in 2 hours by a 7.5W (or more powerful) PD charger.
&gt;
&gt; If you want to use a fast charger, please make sure it's PD type.
&gt; 
&gt; It's also ok if you use a computer USB port for charge, it will take more time than PD charger, at about 3-6 hours. Because of computer USB port usually limit the current supply at 0.5A-1A level.

"Hi,  


I have been deliberating between the Remarkable 2 and Supernote A6x for a while.

I was just about to order the A6x but I saw a lot of people having battery issues. The Remarkable lacks a lot of features against the A6x but the battery is way more superior, it seems.  This is disappointing since rm2 has a 3000 mAh battery vs A6x is smaller with a 2900 mAh battery.

  
However, there have been some latest software updates (one of the 12 days ago) on the A6x and the release notes contains some changes to battery performance. What is the exact status about battery issues right now? If battery is a big deal for me, should I go for rm2 instead? I own both . I cannot recommend the rm2 honestly . Get the a6x or the a5x , stylus is better , more accurate ( never have misalignment issues like I do on the rm2)( no expensive nib replacements ) . Supernote developers are doing fixes and implementing useful and important  features ( have already experienced a few myself ) , where as all the updates on rm2 have been trivial and haven’t really added to the ( already barebones) utility.  I use my a6x many times throughout the day I maybe charge it ever 2 days . The great thing is I charge it with a USB c charger and it charges very quickly , battery is of no concern here coming from someone who’s used it for more than a month now .  The biggest pain point with the rm2 is that you cannot simply plug it in and quickly drag and drop files . You have to use their apps and cloud and other silly workarounds . With the supernote it is just drag and drop , updates instantly . They have also mentioned fixes to help battery further . I recommend supernote Rm2 is also more expensive.

Charging once in two days is not so bad. But do you employ it for heavy use, like taking notes the entire day or something? Sometimes when I’m doing long drawing or long notes i charge every other day . When I’m just using it as a planner many days can go by . So, the weird battery bugs are probably fixed by now, but it still probably stands at somewhere like 6 hours of non-stop writing (from [MyDeepGuide](https://youtu.be/mB8fTVPH1cY?t=948)).

I personally think Supernote is superior simply because you don't need to pay multiple times for a new nib. Though Remarkable 2 and A6X are kind of a bad comparison since, A6X is much smaller. I've had the impression that both A5X and it's upcoming successor (intended to be released Q3 this year), will and are clearly much better than rM2.

Also from what I've heard, rM2 has terrible customer service.

Good question! I also have a rM2--ideally would be great to be able to continue a journal I started on rM2 over to SuperNote. Seems unlikely tho :( I did it by using PDF export.

"Just want to shout out that I got my first e-ink tablet - Supernote A5x! 

I've been thinking about getting one for more than a year, following the development of Sony and Remarkable, and after watching the review by Voja, decided to take a leap and got it.

Quite happy with the device so far, and am excited to find this community and that Supernote is actually seeking users' opinion here!

Happy writing! Agreed! Awesome device paired with amazing customer service and community! I just joined “the family” too, I love that everyone on here (including Ratta Supernote themselves) is so helpful! :) Me too - got mine yesterday and stayed up till 1am figuring out how to customise it and get my stuff on it. Love that Supernote is very active in interacting with the users! And it seems like they will have frequent upgrades.

"I got my A5X yesterday in the post and so far I am loving it!
I am having trouble syncing my Dropbox to the device though. I have connected to my account successfully, and Dropbox has registered that the supernote is connected. 
However when I go to select the folders I want to sync, it does not show my Dropbox folders, only the folders that are already on my device. I've tried rebooting/resetting like a previous post suggested but no luck. Am I missing a step somewhere?
Thanks in advance! I was playing with this last night, and discovered it would only sync folders that were put in the Supernote main folders. It looks like you can’t add folders to those main ones (which are documents, notes, mystyle etc.) To get the main supernote folders to sync you have to select them so they have a tick in the top left hand corner - then they appear in Dropbox) you can then move files into them.

"Morning Coach just posted a quick snapshot of 6 ways the Supernote A5X beats the reMarkable 2:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL3wJnqN2P0&amp;feature=youtu.be

I sent back the RM2 because it looked good but didn’t offer much functionality. Then I returned the Note Air had the opposite problem – bloated with apps and a complicated user interface that made work harder. 

Supernote A5X seems to solve both problems with refined apps built for purpose and a simple, streamlined interface to get things done without any headaches. I’d rather be working on a task than working out how to use the device. This video should be shown to everyone that loves remarkable 2 over other devices lol. Other than sketching, supernote can do everything remarkable can do, and BETTER Well... wait for his ""6 reasons to get Remarkable 2 over A5X"" video in a few days ;) Altho, as an owner of both, I am currently won over by the A5X (even tho I still really enjoy the ""feel"" of the rM2 device and writing when I pick it up and use it). The functionality of the A5X has won me over (love keywords), and not having to replace nibs! Since you have both devices, can you describe the writing experience of Supernote versus reMarkable? A lot of users have trouble describing writing on a Supernote. 

Also, which stylus do you have - the ceramic or the Lamy (I still have my Lamy which I loved using). Remarkable 2 has a ""scratchier"" free. Not in a bad way--in a good way. I guess the best analogy I've heard is: it feels like using a pencil on paper laying on a table or clipboard. It's feels like a harder surface, but again--not in a bad way. Frankly, I still feel like I might prefer it to the A5X feel--even tho the A5X feel is also very good. Yep, I know, maybe not the most helpful.

The A5X has a smoother/slicker feel... and it also depends upon which A5X pen you use. I have both the Heart of Metal and Lamy. The Lamy has a slight scratchier feel, because it's plastic. The HOM is very smooth (ceramic). In reality, the A5X and Remarkable are probably very similar in smoothness--but the Remarkable seems to have more friction/scratchiness due to the sound of its tip on its surface.

FWIW--even though I may enjoy the feel of the remarkable more, i like the sharpness of the A5X pens more. I feel like I can write cleaner/thinner lines on the A5X due to the different pen/surface (especially with the HOM).

As far as which A5X pen I prefer--I still don't know. When I switch to the Lamy, I think ""oohhhh yeah--I think this feels better"". But then I'll use that for awhile, and then switch back to the HOM, and think ""yep, I like the sharpness with this"". So, I guess--get them both if you can(!) I DO love the eraser button on the Lamy--extremely useful. And while I wish the design was a bit better (so I didnt have to find  and line up my finger with the erase button everytime I grab the Lamy), I still think the Lamy is great especially if you think you'll be erasing more than usual. The way I look at it--the Lamy is an eraser I bought that also has a built-in pen ;) And the HOM is for when I just want sharp lines and I'm not worried about making mistakes and/or needing to use the eraser much. The UI's erase function still works well with either one, so not a big deal--but the Lamy's eraser button is very convenient once you have it and get used to it.",Morning Coach lists 6 reasons why Supernote A5X beats reMarkable 2,title prediction
"Dull - but necessary question.  I'd like to use my supernote for both personal purposes and work and therefore do have some questions about how my data is used. There are quite a few users in here from Europe (where GDPR or UK GDPR is applicable).  I had a look at your privacy policy and note that it says that it's only applicable for mainland China.  There is also a statement which says, ""In principle, the personal information we collect and generate in China will be stored in China"" [https://supernote.com.cn/user/PrivacyPolicyEn.html](https://supernote.com.cn/user/PrivacyPolicyEn.html) However you will be processing data which is generated elsewhere and stored in your servers either in China or Amazon Japan.   Please can someone provide more transparency about what happens with our data.  It's worth looking at RM's privacy policy as it does at least contain more specific info about what happens to our data. I usually don t care about this stuff, my data being anyway sold in every part of the globe, but tag me when someone replies, because now I am curious as well. Well... if you're using this as a digital notebook, you're likely storing more than just basic identity info such as email or phone number (the typical data sold around the world). People may choose to store very sensitive information in their notes... if the data is not protected, that data could be exposed. Which is why I'm very leery of putting any sensitive data in my A5X until I have the ability to store in a different service such as Google Drive. Even then, I'm still not fully trusting enough to put sensitive data in this device :( Thank you for bringing this up - it's something very reasonable to ask. I have the same problem as you because I want to use these devices for work and some of the things I write or draw could eventually become IP. If the data gets in the wrong hands, it's pretty well known some Chinese companies can steal and not care about IP ownership laws.
I'm really encouraged by Ratta's responses on this subreddit so would be great to hear from them on this. This is very important!

There are two types of data that will transfer to the server

The first is cloud services

In order to comply with Chinese laws (all companies providing information services in China must set up servers in China. Apple is no exception). But this doen't matter with users outside of China. What we said,  ""In principle, the personal information we collect and generate in China will be stored in China"" is mainly for chinese users. Don't worry about that.

If you want to use Supernote cloud service, we strongly recommend  do not use a Chinese server. (Amazon Japanese server is now available, US server/EU server is coming soon). Otherwise, you can use Dropbox instead. I don’t need to confirm if you are not a Chinese user, because Chinese users cannot see this message (Reddit is blocked in China).

Anyway. The most thorough method, you can turn off the cloud service. Use USB data cable, U disk and other methods to transfer data with computer.

The second is the User Experience Project.

If you agree to participate in the User Experience Project, we will upload some logs. It is usually the performance info in some operation events, such as the time it takes to open the file, the data of battery consumption, and the related information when the fault occurs. We use these data to evaluate and improve performance. It will not be used for purposes not related to improving performance. We will list log types and uses in detail later and update on the website. You are right, We need transparency.

If we need more detailed information for special purposes, such as improving the rendering of handwriting. We will launch a special volunteer program, where participants can send samples of their non-privacy note files to our collection mailbox. We will not store such data in the log.

Anyway, you can refuse to participate in the User Experience Project to avoid uploading any information.

I want to say that your concerns are absolutely necessary.

I.e. when exporting a note as a pdf, it would be great if I could have supernote insert a margin around the note. 

This would be useful if one wished make notes on the exported note using something like Skim on the computer. It would also be useful if the notes are to be submitted to a marker, as the marker would have more space to write comments.

"Just wondering about a possible implementation of a way to rapidly switch between two apps - like ALT-TAB on a computer. At the moment if I want to switch between a note and a book I have to swipe the side bar, then tap on the thing I want. This is pretty good. 

But I just wonder if there could be an option in settings to remap an up-swipe from screen refresh to app-switch. This would make an make it a really quick way to move between two things. 

If this option was selected, the screen refresh function could be activated by an on-screen button in the toolbar. Similarly, if the user chose to keep swipe up to refresh, then the toolbar button could active the app switch.

Just a thought! Interested to hear what others think. I do also really like swipe up to refresh, but for me personally I think I would get more use from switching apps.

Also, the ability to wake the device with a swipe (up or down) would be a nice touch - I find myself trying to do this anyway! :) I think clicking the button to wake to sleep is enough for me, even on my Boox it’s the same thing.

As for the swipe up to switch apps, I like it how it is now (swipe up to refresh), I actually have the same gesture on my Boox. Given that the limited number of apps is visible on swipe down anyway, I find that enough to switch between apps/documents really quickly. I would like this as an option, too. Perhaps it could be an option for the swipe up, to change in settings? Much like the first iPad allowed the switch to be either screen lock or something else (was it mute?), depending on user preference. I hardly use the swipe up. I think it would be awesome to customize and have users choose what they want that action to be. Personally I would like it to open the last most recent note or file so I can quickly switch between two. This would be a neat addition.",Swipe up for rapid app switching (and wake from sleep),title prediction

"I have 6 custom templates... they appear in the device's MyStyle folder, but only 4 of the 6 appear in the Template-&gt;Customization selection screen. Also, there are 2 templates I initially added but then deleted. Everything looks fine on the SuperNote (Japanese) cloud server/website, as well. It's just the the template-&gt;Customization screen that is messed up (only shows some of the custom PNGs I added, and 2 that I deleted are still there).

Yes, I have rebooted--a couple times, and I have sync'd a few times. I also made sure the MyStyle folder was checkmarked in the sync settings.

So... help... More details... I've played with the filenames of the png/template files I uploaded. I made them shorter and removed periods from them. I now get 4 of the 6 templates in my Customization template pages, and the deleted ones are gone. So now, I'm missing 2 of the 6. Is there a reason it will only show the first row of 4 in there? A common issue is the use of special characters in filenames as you have already discovered by removing periods from your filenames. Although the Supernote manuals list various characters to avoid they fail to include underscores in their list ( \_ ) which is often the culprit for custom templates not showing up. No underscores. The files that appear in the Customization page have the same format as those not appearing. Only use letters, numbers and spaces in the fielnames.

"Hey guys, just discovered e-ink devices recently and been doing some research. Even though i love the idea behind it, and am very intrigued to get one, I'm still between the fences about whether i really need one. 

Therefore, I'd like to find out what you guys are really using it for and what made you buy one. After all they aren't cheap devices and i wanna make sure I'm not wasting money. I use it as a daily planner , brain dump, sketch book , notebook all in one place. Helps me to organise my thoughts and notes beyond what I could with a regular notebook. Plus I just much prefer handwriting then typing on computer in meetings etc, I can concentrate better and also be more free in structure which helps me. Finally, the A5X is just so nice to write on that I now actually write more and I’m less precious about pages too! I should add that I also love that it’s not a tablet per say, so less distractions, blue light and need to recharge often. Not to mention no glass! I also own iPad Pro with pencil, and i love using the ipad with pencil mainly for marking up pdfs and notes. I also use it for board games (i'm a big boardgamer), in which I'll track game status/characters/etc by using PDF game sheets in Notability (ipad note taking app), and marking 'em up. BUT... I got intrigued by e-ink note takers for the better non-glass feel and to get away from staring into a computer/lit display. With that said... I'm fairly new with a rM2 and A5X. The software is generations behind iPad... but the e-ink/non-glass experience makes it worth if. Will I be solely e-ink and no iPad for note taking? Not sure. But right now, ive been 100% A5X (after starting with rM2) for about 4 weeks. Also using it for tracking workouts (I maintain a daily workout journal), general daily notes... and the keyword feature on the A5X has won me over, as it allows my to label/tag journal spots for easy searching. Software is quirky/buggy (e.g. the cloud sync functionality), but I'm hopeful (based upon Ratta's strong customer involvement/dialog) these will be ironed out and improved. Before I ve bought the A6X, I wanted to write, but the thought that pages end filled me with dread, so I didn t write. It s a poor excuse, because I do not write even after I acquired an infinite amounf of digital pages.

If I had the money, I would have definitely gone with the iPad Pro, but I am glad I didn t. 

An e-ink tablet is the perfect substitute for a notepad and that s all it is to it.

What sold it to me was the infinite pen and the community that they ve build on reddit, the last being the most important. Now, thinking about it, whatever they would sell, I would buy.

Hi u/Hex2asc,

I’ve had my A5X a few days and I think it’s fantastic. Here is some initial feedback, requests and questions:

&amp;#x200B;

**Feature requests**

* Please can we have caps lock on the keyboard
* Please can we have a way to add accents to letters in the keyboard
* There should be the ability to change the date format (eg dd/mm/yy) from the default American format of month-day
* Should be able to send PNG attachments in email. Currently, sending attachments only works with PDF, while PNG attachments are ignored
* Please can we have indented lists in Word when using bullets?

**Questions**

* In word, is there some way to erase a handwritten mark or writing?   
If I make a mistake while adding handwritten text or marking up, there seems to be no way to delete it, other than double-tapping to convert it and then deleting it after conversion, which is really laborious. It would be great to have an eraser button.

**Other feedback/bugs**

* When switching from handwriting to typing in Word or when turning on repage view, any hand writing on the page is deleted without any warning or asking to convert it first. This is a serious issue and can cause a lot of lost work.
* Backspace connect does not work as described in the manual 
* You can't rename a Word doc when it’s open the way you can with a note. This feels inconsistent
* When renaming a doc or note from the files overview, the 'x' is too far to the right (this does not affect the function, it’s just is an aesthetic UI bug)
* Deleting a document in the cloud from the browser interface does not work. You get a confirmation, but the file stays in the folder, even after sync. The only way to delete it is from the A5X device itself, which then works across the device and the cloud after syncing.

Thank you in advance for your consideration and keep up the great work! Just a quick feedback on ""Please can we have caps lock on the keyboard"".

I can simply double click the ""Shift"" (big up arrow) key. I agree for the date, it is really confusing, it should adjust based on the timezone or let us define the way we want to appear ""Deleting a document in the cloud from the browser interface does not  work.

Awesome! Somehow none of the  reviews I have watched mention the hyperlink support. And I had a very very negative experience with the Remarkable's software making me cautious purchasing cool looking but expensive products.

Is the table of contents collapsible and respecting the hierarchy? I.e. is it easy to navigate a book with four chapters but hundreds of paragraphs in the TOC? Or everything is on the same level (making it difficult to find the chapters)? If the latter, is it on the timeline to fix it?

And is there an option to search for PDF metadata? I plan to have many pdfs on the device and I would like to search for authors/title/arxiv number (if the title is long, then it's not practical to use it as a file name) etc. This fantastic mate.

"All of the other e-ink devices are available on either Android or Linux platforms. Supernote is the only device that gives you a choice because its tablets are available with either operating system. Amazing.

I’d like to know what users see as the pros and the cons of both platforms. Do Supernote’s Linux products have a faster processing speed or better latency? Do the Android devices offer better functionality? 

Why do you think one is better than the other, based on your use case? I’d love to know what Ratta thinks as well and why they are committed to producing two versions of the A6 and A5. I went with the A5X because although I don't use Kindle it seems like the Android OS has more potential for additional functionality in future. It's been working great so far - it does slow down a lot when I'm drawing and using the copy/paste and resizing features heavily but honestly I don't really mind that as drawing really isn't the primary reason I got it. I also can't comment on whether the A5 is any better in this respect - maybe someone else could add something here?

I saw it said somewhere that although the battery capacity is greater on the A5X the android OS is more demanding and so the battery life is actually lower - again I don't have a point of comparison but I certainly haven't had any issues with battery life, keeps going for multiple days.

"I preordered the A6X and I've really enjoyed it as my first ereader and note taking device. However, there are basic navigation features that would make it much easier to use.

It's annoying to flip through tens of pages when navigating through documents and digests. There should be an an option to skip multiple pages, skip to the end, and enter a page number (similar to when navigating documents). Even better would be searching for files or folders in the current directory or skipping by alphabetic ordering (skip to where Hs or Vs begin like a contact book).

It would be nice to have a back button when navigating documents. So when I open a folder, I can go back to the same page in the document navigator rather than flipping through all the pages to get back to the same page.

Most if not all good epub readers automatically embed links to footnotes, so you don't need to flip to the references pages to find the footnote. It'd be really nice if I could tap on a footnote and have the footnote appear in a little window.

One should be able to annotate digests in the document viewer, rather than navigating to the digests app.

Each of these features would improve the ease of use a lot for me. In addition, having a overview that shows a grid of all pages like the remarkable would make it much easier to navigate visually when you don’t already know which page number you want You are in luck!! All of these options are available on your device already! Taping the ellipse in the toolbar brings up the menu which the overview option which brings up page thumbnails. u/official_marcoms. Taping on the page numbers opens up the ability to jump to any page you would like. Dragging down from the top of the screen allows you to search all directories by file name, keywords or stared pages. I highly recommend running through the user manual there are a lot of hidden tools and gestures built into different parts of the device and Ratta is always listening to its users for more feedback! I think I wasn't clear on the page skipping. I don't mean the pages in a document, I mean the pages when browsing through files and folders. It would be great if the same functionality to skip to a page in a document also worked when browsing a folder of documents. I sometimes reverse the sorting so I can at least flip through each page in the list of documents from the reverse of the alphabetic order.

I like the search function, this is ends up being the best way to go. Searching in the current directory is what I usually want, but this isn't so important.

I realized the last feature is in the user manual. I was tapping digests with the stylus, but I figured out that I need to tap it with my finger to annotate a digest.",Feature Request: Navigation and Usability,title prediction

"Random notes from today's waste management class on Vermicomposting. I really like taking notes by hand I find that I remember more of the content when I draw and doolie the ideas out. This is one of the many reasons I really enjoy my supernote. It has become part of my study pattern to go back, edit and clean up the doolies a bit. After class, I will take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour adding to the notes and doodles. The post by u/teicherus of the [possible colors values](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/lmo94r/possible_color_values_for_templates/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) on the SN have me excited about the potential of the current hard wear and to see what other tools are to come! 

Additionally, I enjoyed the use of the floating toolbar, however, I wish I could turn it horizontal again.  I used to keep it docked to left hands side of notes and it was rarely in my way (right-handed). I very much like the ability to collapse it and move it freely but if I could have the choice, either in the settings or on the toolbar, to select horizontal or vertical position when free that would be awesome. Seems like it might be an easy addition?

One other thing I really love is the title page, its use for building a table of contents is perfect functionality! However, I don't like the hash marks. I would like to still be able to differentiate the title without effectively crossing them out.  Is there currently a way to disable that or a workaround anyone has found? For future updates, I personally would rather brackets around the title much like the diegest. Or even a box but the hash marks kinda kill it for me.

The only thing I miss about taking notes on paper is that I used a lot of color-coding and go back through and watercolor them. One day a super note with a color E-ink screen,... now that would be pretty sweet..

I'm trying to figure out how to get a pen that is heavier overall because I'm finding I don't press hard enough to get that feeling of resistance anymore.

You covered all of the features and attributes of the three pens extensively, including the writing experiences. Just what I needed to know. These styluses are another reason to love Supernote.

Just one thing I’m curious about — spoiler alert — I assume the HOM pen is also your favourite for drawing, but what about marking up documents where you’d use a stylus to highlight text rather than write? ... Would Lamy’s “gliding over the paper” be better here than HOM’s “digging into the paper” sensation?

Whatever the case, it’s good to see one manufacturer offering high quality pens (plural) that deliver different benefits to different users. I don't own the basic pen, only the Lamy and the HOM, but I agree with you even if my opinion isn't perhaps as strong!

Now I own the Max Lumi, too, but my go-to is still the Supernote for the calendar, general note-making and the reading smaller page-sized PDFs. I just love the feel of the screen with the HOM! The digest annotation feauture, the sharpness of the screen rendering, the ability to star your faviourites, the way you can organise a notebook, the support team, etc., make this one of the best purchases I have made in a long time, and your videos were key to that, so thanks!

"I've been on and off the last few months waiting to get the RM2, until I discovered SuperNote, and I have a few questions.

1) The A5x and A6x are basically the same exact thing, except for the size of the device? I read elsewhere on the reddit that palm-rejection is missing on the smaller one too, but it's on the road map?

&amp;#x200B;

2) As someone who will use the device for taking various notes, how much of a deal breaker is the size of the A6x vs the A5x in your opinion? I may do some lite kindle reading, but I highly doubt it.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Any general reviews, tips, tricks, etc are welcome. I haven't seen much on here, but I've spent time watching videos from CPO, MyDeepGuide, GoodeReader, and a few other channels. 1. They run the exact same firmware, so functionally yes. The screen of the smaller one/A6X is glass and the larger one/A5X is... not-glass (plastic?)... but same film on the screen. The smaller one has higher ppi. The A6X actually does have palm rejection (I use it!) I think I’ve read here the A5X that doesn’t have it yet but I’m not sure. 

2. For note taking, I would base it on your preferred size of paper notebook. I literally tried measuring it out before I bought one to get a feel for the size haha. A6X screen is basically the size of an iPad mini screen. I think it’s a great size because it’s about the size of the notebooks it replaced for me (Moleskine Large)  but it’s really dependent on what you are comfortable with. 

3. [I did a short sort-of-review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/l7rgn5/a6x_initial_reviewfirst_impressions_latency_etc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) when I got my A6X, with some photo comparisons etc. which might help you decide! I'll make sure to check out the review (I started to earlier, but got sidetracked watching some videos on the devices).

&amp;#x200B;

To try and put size into perspective, if it's a standard college-ruled notebook (or maybe a 1-inch binder) how do the devices compare? 2. Keep in mind that the A6 writing area is small. 4 and 5/8 inch by 6 and 1/8 inch. The external size of the A6X is about the size of an A5 notebook. So if you are used a Moleskine or Leuchtturm1917, you'll want to go with the A5X even though the external size of the A5X is bigger than those notebooks. 

3. If you write small like me, you may go with the 0.2 nib size. But on the A5X, the lines look a bit jagged. Ratta is working on this issue. On the A6X, the higher resolution means I find it more comfortable to write in my usual handwriting size without the cognitive dissonance of the jagged lines. But I like having the physical screen real estate of the A5X. One thing that helped me with the nib size issue is to use a finer point stylus. Those are definitely closer to A5X.

The photos in the post I linked show the A6X, open, next to Rhodia and Moleskine notebooks and a Kindle Paperwhite for reference. I don’t share the experience of the poster below at finding it small (you’ll see in the photo the screen width is about the same as a page on a Moleskine), but you sound like you’re used to much larger paper notebooks so I would skew larger!",Opinions,title prediction
"I have a 6X. When I set it down on a metal cart near my work station it goes to sleep so I could not see my notes. I was getting frustrated thinking maybe that was an intended function to save battery or something. Just realized it only happens on the metal cart. When I set it down on another surface it stay on. Maybe an interaction with the magnet that is used to trigger sleep/wake? Hi u/betterwithchem, I have the same issue on a metal Ikea balcony table. The whole A5X actually feels to stick to the table slightly when the cover flap is folded underneath. Try leaving the cover open like a normal book, instead of folding over and underneath the device. I have better results like that usually... That is definetly the sleep function the supernote has for its folio. When ever the folio closes the supernote will go to sleep and when opened it will wake up the supernote. This is done with magnets. Since the table is metal the supernote's think it's the folio in its closed position and it goes to sleep, try placing something like a book or a cardboard between the supernote and the surface to avoid that problem. Maybe even consider using a stand. /u/hex2asc Is there a way we can get a switch in the settings to disable close-to-sleep?

"I use my A5X to take notes primarily, but thinking of trying the RM2 because I have been less than impressed with battery life? Any thoughts? I have the A6X and RM2 and honestly prefer the A6X.  The RM2 seems bulky even though it isn't really.  I like how the a6x feels to write on (though I hate the new movable menu.  HATE), and the RM2 does not feel like paper.  The menus seem more difficult to navigate, though I probably just need more practice.  If yoyve already got the a5x id just stick with that. &gt;already got the a5x id just stick with that.

My thought as well. Battery life on the rM2 is great when the device is idling (not in use) when in use it's not that great, but more than enough. You might get better battery life with the rM2 (don't have both, can't compare) but the difference won't be that big, and the rM2 is more fragile (glass based screen, some people have problem with the little button because it's in a zone that easy to shock, etc.). If you have a SN and it suits your need, no need to bother with the rM2 IMO, unless battery life when idling is your main criteria. Yes, I have both, and I have to say, it's a really tough call between them, but at the moment, I'm leaning more to the A5X.

Points in the RM2's favor:
* Significantly longer battery life
* Best writing feel (in my opinion)
* Calligraphy pen (I love it!)
* Thumbnails show writing on PDFs (this is important to me because I edit a lot of PDFs and it's easier to keep track of what document I've worked on)

Points in the A5X's favor:
* Ceramic nib, no more replacing plastic nibs
* Continued platform development (calligraphy pen coming soon, along with many other developments)
* Wakes up when folio is opened

The ceramic nib is what tips my preference for the A5X: I hate the idea of having to replace nibs every two weeks to a month (depending on how much writing I'm doing) and gives me the mental freedom to write and write without thinking about how I'm wearing down the nib, or ordering new ones, and so on. The fact that Ratta is so responsive to users also stands in stark contrast with Remarkable's radio silence. I know that the Supernote platform will continue to improve, so I'm willing to wait for things like a calligraphy pen. (And they are also working on battery life -- it's never going to reach the same level as RM2's, but I wouldn't be surprised if they managed to get another day out of the existing design.)

If what you're looking for is for someone to assuage your concerns that you may have made a wrong decision, here it is: stick with the A5X, the Remarkable is not significantly better to justify forking over a ton of money for similar functionality. Yes, the battery life is better, and I love the feel, but unless the A5X's battery life is causing you major headaches, stick with what you've got.",Does anyone have Remarkable 2 and Supernote A5X?,title prediction

"I recently returned a reMarkable 2 and replaced it with the A5x. Overall I'm happy with the switch, but there are two features I REALLY miss:

1. The send to reMarkable Chrome plugin which allowed me to send pretty much any article I found online to my reMarkable as a PDF. Amazing! Any chance Ratta could offer something like that?
2. The ability to simply flip the stylus around and use the other end as an eraser. It is so much easier and more natural. And yes, I have the Lamy pen but don't use it at all because my finger often accidentally pushes the erase button. If you print from you desktop and save to your Dropbox folder (if you sync that way) it is just as quick in my experience. 

But I also am on a Mac and don’t like chrome. So I am not the most objective. 

On my iPhone I use the Instaweb browser and it prints to an a5 pdf format which i save to my Dropbox folder and it is quicker and more reliable than the remarkable app in my experience. 

I am supportive of the idea of a chrome plugin. But I think the syncing options on supernote make it unneeded Thank you for your feedbacks. I think something will be change. I haven't found the dropbox synching to be that easy to set up. And it's hard to imagine anything easier than being on a site like The Atlantic, going to the top right of the browser and clicking the button that says ""send to reMarkable"" and having it instantly appear on your tablet.

"Wondering if anyone else lately is noticing issues with the screen? I've had my A6X for about 6 - 8 months, but the last probably month or so am noticing some issues (Tried looking for similar problems but didn't see any, if I've missed this issue posted somewhere else please let me know!)

*Processing video 0vi6y64bq9q61...*

1. Not recognising touch. I've attached a video from this morning. It's not all the time, but happening probably every 2nd day now, it randomly won't recognise touch input - only pen; or vice versa. Restarting does work, but I often have to restart 2 or 3 times for it to work, and sometimes it won't restart (it just sits there refusing to accept either input). 
2. The bottom half of the screen seems to be not always responding properly to pen input. Having trouble filming this, as I notice it mostly during lectures when I'm writing a LOT in a short amount of time, and am willing to accept that it could well be me writing in a hurry and causing the issue. Occasionally when I write, the words/strokes are half missing, like a pen running out of ink. And on the right-hand size, about 1/3rd of the way down, there's a weird ""blip"" section where if I draw a straight line, it instead sometimes curves outwards (again, hard to film, it doesn't seem to do it when I want to hahaha) or if I write on lined templates near there it won't write in that spot, instead bunching the letters up behind it as if I were trying to write off the edge.

I haven't dropped, damaged, banged, spilled anything on, sat near or on a magnetic device, or in any other way I can think of caused any damages to the device, I study from home and it lives on my desk 95% of the time. Any thoughts? I'll try to get a video of the ""low ink"" issue asap. Hopefully this is just a simple thing fixed in the next update :) I have similar issues but mine do not seem as prevalent as yours. At times my A5X will not recognize a finger touch until I use the stylus first. But after I use the stylus once it usually goes back to normal. Yeah, it used to do that rarely, but this has become much more pronounced, and the only fix I can find so far is a restart (or three hahaha). It's not happening often enough to really be a huge problem or anything, but the increase has me a bit worried. And the words not writing properly at the bottom are a bit concerning too, but I'm still not sure if that's just how I'm writing, or a genuine issue. Hey mate, are you still experiencing this issue or did Rata sort it out yet? I've been looking to get one of these devices but have seen this complaint pop up a couple times and am just wondering if its an ongoing thing. I was, and ended up emailing about it, and they replaced the device. I am having some possible issues with the new one, but not sure yet if that's just me (different problem). Regardless, I absolutely love mine, even if there are a few bugs or problems. I think pretty much every company will have issues like this, but the stand-out thing for me is their customer service and support. Even with the issues, they've been fantastic at talking it out and trying to sort out the issues; plus they listen to us as customers when we suggest changes or things we'd like to see.",Screen Issues,title prediction
"I have a couple of custom Note templates I use for meetings. One has a Title/Attendee/Follow Up area at the top that I use as the first page of notes for any meeting, and then when I continue taking notes on the next page, I change to the 8mm rule stock template. Then the next time I have a new meeting for the same client or project, I switch back to my custom template for that first new meeting note page.  


So, my request(s):

&amp;#x200B;

* Can we have an option to sort templates with custom ones first when we go to template selection? That would put my three custom ones first, and then the 8mm ruled one would be immediately following, and I would not need to go to the next page of templates every single time a new meeting comes up.
* In the alternative, give us the ability to rename templates so we can then sort them in any order by name.
* This third is a long shot. Can we specify how many pages a template will be used when selected, and then the one to follow it? So, I can have my custom template selected, and when I go to the next page, it will automatically shift to the ruled template I select as the second page of any meeting. Then I'll only need to select my own template for the first page of a meeting, and not need to select any other. This should override the system default for the Note template.

Thanks! I was thinking last night how much easier it'd be to be able to sort the templates, just hold to rearrange so the most-used are first in the list or something. Most used or last used would work very well for my use case. I just hate to go to the second page of templates for no good reason almost every time I have a meeting. Agreed, I use mine mainly for study and have made up some templates for definitions or equations and some summary sheets for lectures or chapter notes, and having to keep scrolling through them all to set those up for each lecture is not quite ""annoying"" as such, but it would be simplified with the option to arrange how I'd like. It's not a hugely inconvenient thing, but I was uploading more last night and starting to realise just how many I have now, and thinking that it's going to become a bit harder to find what I want (I am a self-confessed digital-hoarder and can absolutely guarantee I'll end up with way more templates than I need or use regularly hahaha) Most used or let the user rearrange the order to their own accord.",Feature Request - Template Sort Order,title prediction

"First, I’d like to thank this forum, as it has been key for my decision to buy this fantastic device. I reserved a Remarkable last summer and changed my mind after being surprised on how responsive the Supernote community was.

I’ve used the A5X for more than 2 months now and I absolutely love it. I’m not the artist-type of user and my goal was to use it as a replacement of my work paper-based notebooks. I have to say the A5X nails it for this purpose.

However, there’s always gap for improvement and I’d like to request some improvements that will make my life easier.

1) Move pages to other notes. Believe this was already requested. To me this is a key feature as the copy-paste is not always working as expected.
2) Improvements in copy-paste. It happened to me a couple of times that I paste something on the wrong place and didn’t find the way to redo the paste. It looks like the clipboard is emptied after the paste so, if you undo it, you lose the copied data. This made me lose some selections and makes me now be very careful with the copy-paste.
3) Digest without comments. I think the digest feature has a lot of potential. I use it intensively as a marker without adding comments. When retrieving the digest I see lots of blank spaces and even an option to remove the “marked” text and keep only the comments. I’d love to have it the other way around. A version without comments, so that I can get a summarized version of the book based on the marked text.
4) Improved sensitivity on the toolbar. Not sure of this but I recently got the feeling that, since I upgraded to one of the latest versions, I need to press harder to make a selection on the toolbar (e.g. switch between the pen and the rubber). This is also a bit annoying as sometimes I have to try 2 or 3 times before getting the correct tool. I believe there has to be a way to increase its sensitivity so that’s easier to select.

I hope my comments help to improve this already-amazing device. Thanks for your feedback and great suggestions! Thanks for your sincere feedback and suggestions. Yes,  the function of moving pages to other notes , which is one of the most important features that will be available in the future, each page is independent which should be moved between different notebook freely , that is similar to a binder.   Additionally,  ""a version without comments in digest"" and ""improving the sensitivity on the toolbar"" will all been submitted  to the IT team for further optimization.   Best Regards Thanks for your quick response as usual.

I have two more requests, I've just realized:

1) Be able to remove ""Star Mark"" from the search. When I search for star marks, it finds  stars that are not viewable in the note. What I mean is that I open the note and I cannot find the start mark. I believe maybe a dot or something very small is detected as a star. As I cannot delete it from the note, I believe the best would be to be able to delete it from the search page (e.g. long press to have the option to delete)

2) Select button on the ""compressed"" floating toolbar. The compressed toolbar is a great idea but I miss the selection button, which forces me to extend it. I think it would be great to have it there together with the pen, rubber, do and undo buttons.",A5X feedback after 2 months,title prediction

"Hi Everyone,

I know these kinds of questions have been asked a lot already, but I would still prefer some feedback on my specific use-case. First things first, I am planning on buying a reader and am deciding between the A5x and the Boox Note Air. I want to use the tablet to read academic journal articles while sitting outside in the sun. Now, most of what I will be doing is just reading, though I will generally do some note-scribbling at the side of pages as well. It sounds as if the Lumi Max would be my ideal option, mainly due to its size, but I don't really want to spend $900 on this so I'm stuck between the A5x and the Note Air. Voya, and others, seem to suggest that the Note Air has a slightly better/faster reader, which, I think, would be very important for me. On the other hand, It's a bit more expensive since you have to get an extra pen and, from my understanding, does not have the same Dropbox support that the Supernote has.

Has anybody tackled the question from a similar standpoint? Would really appreciate some more thoughts.

Thanks I have owned the Lumi and the A5X and prefer the A5X because the screen is more crisp (less layers between base panel and your eyes), the pen is better, the annotation features are smart (digest and stars), it feels more durable and notebook-like, and the company is very receptive to feedback. However, Boox devices are very, very fast. Much faster than the Supernote, although I don’t mind the occasional 1-2 second delay in between gestures etc. because I love what the device stands for. The PDF reflow/crop/landscape mode features on the Boox are more advanced than what the Supernote has currently. The Boox Max Lumi and Note Air don’t feel like very well thought out devices, but their capabilities are very powerful if you know what you are doing in the Android ecosystem. 

Tl;Dr: I owned a Lumi and sold it because the text wasn’t very crisp (too many layers on the screen) and the pen sucked. The A5X is a quality, purpose built device with a perfect pen for notetaking and annotating simpler, one-column a4 PDFs but anything more complex and you will meet its limitations very quick. Some thoughts: the Boox Note Air is based on a Carta screen, it has a thin layer of glass and can break quite easily. The A5X (or Note 3) might be more durable.

A5X is more on a minimalist approach even though it's android based. 

I'd say that there is more chances that you get long term support on the A5X, Onyx tends to release new devices and to forget about older ones, that receive no software updates when new models are released. Hard to tell how Ratta will be on the long run on that front, but from what we can read, them seem to be planning to provide upgrades for longer than Onyx.",A5X vs Note Air for PDF annotating,title prediction

Just wondering how it would holdup when the tip would fall on a hard flour i.e. hardwood or paving stone when in garden. I guess time will tell.

I was torn between 6X and 5X. Mobility versus writing space. I intend to transition from A5 paper notebook BJ, of which I started the 7th now, to the SN. Have scanned in the paper BJ's converted to PDF which I intent to import to SN and create a grant index page. Planning to use/utilise/create a template for daily sheet that has some pre-set goal trackers / quotes or at least space for them that should stay on the page  for a whole month or even year as a reminder and without having to flick pages. So space would be already taken up by that and in that respect the A5x made more sense. A5x also allows more flexibility when going to draw concepts/mindmaps/process diagrams etc.

Also looking forward to using this as a learning driver. For example if one wants to learn all chemical elements you could use one layer to show an empty periodic table and then try to fill out all elements and their properties from memory on another layer and the repeat by deleting the 2nd layer without having to re-draw or print out the table structure and all that without  a paper mess and no need for a printer. I have/tried the Galaxy Tab S7 pen, the Staedtler Noris Jumbo, the HoM, and the standard Sn pen.  The HoM is fine, but the one I use most is the standard pen it came with.  I'm still eying the LAMY, for the eraser button.  But It's hard to justify spending another $60-70USD for a 4th pen (I returned the Jumbo).  

I prefer not having to replace nibs.  I do have the same question about ""impact durability"" though.  Thankfully I haven't yet had to find out.  

I really was using a daily planner template with a Tasks, Meetings-at-a-glance, Quick Notes, and Scratchpad page for every day of the year.  I've fallen out of the habit lately though and pretty much have only been using it for meeting notes.  I like your learning driver method. I also just ordered.

"Hi, everyone! I'm wondering about your experience using the proofreading tools on the Supernote.

If so - why start with a Pentagram? Am I able to turn it off in this version? I'd love a auto-draw feature like procreate has. This would make the Supernote so much more useful! It’s in the manual under Symbol recognition I believe. You can search for the star symbols in your notes/documents Thanks for the quick reply. Missed it in the manual apparently.

What I do is draw the star next to the note.  Then, I can later tap on what looks like a table of contents symbol in the top left of the menu bar, and the star symbol in the right corner of that menu, and see all of the pages I've starred in that file.

My only gripes are: 1) it doesn't always recognize the star when I draw it, and 2) it would be great if I could select some of the text what I starred so I could see it in the ToC view instead of have to jump to the page in order to read it.",What's up with the supernote converting a drawn pentagram into a perfectly drawn one?,title prediction

"I wasn't sure whether to write this post or not. I was planning on using an ewriter to organise all my notes and lists at home (I seem to generate 100's of sheets of paper). The problem for me is it's for personal use and so not offset against tax etc which means I'm fairly price sensitive and these things are unfortunately close to the limit of what I'll pay.

Getting unbiased info on these devices is quite difficult. The youtube reviewers were very positive on the A5X but then they were very positive on every ewriter they reviewed which didn't really help me much. I ended up trawling through hours of reviews trying to work out the pros and cons of every device and tried to work out what would suit me best. In the end I chose the A5X as I liked the design, the ease of use and the extra functionality that keeps getting added. 

Two days ago I thought damn it, I'll just buy it. I knew the discount price was finished and had convinced myself that the full price was worth it. Then a shipping charge of $57 got added. I figured I better check the functionality to make sure I'm getting exactly what I want and stopped the order. A day later, I'd got the answers I needed here, and I thought I should still go ahead and place my order. I picked the standard package. OK'ed the shipping price, then was told about possible extra taxes etc to the UK. I gave up at that point.

I'm sure the A5X is great but I can't test it before buying and it seems I can't even work out what I'm I'll actually be paying. I decided not go ahead and instead just rely on paper and pencil for the moment. Hopefully it will appear on Amazon in the future and hopefully I'll be able to afford it. I hear you. It's expensive. All these ewriters are. And it's certainly not essential. It's a tough call. I decided (i.e., believe without actually trying yet) that it will work for what I'm looking for (one thing is to free me from needing to sit in front of my computer to read and annotate long PDFs). But I agree that it would be so much nicer to have a model one could try first. If I were you I'd stay connected here because if a deal on a used device comes available, your best bet for hearing about it will be right here. I decided to go ahead and order (with all the extra shipping and taxes to Canada), because I think this will make a big difference in my workflow (for my actual job).

I definitely intend to use the first 30 days (during which it can be returned for full refund) to see if I like it, and it provides the functionality I want/need. As you pointed out, buying expensive ""toys"" without being able to try them first is a bit of a leap, but I have NO PROBLEMS shipping it back for a refund if I decide it won't work for me. Frankly, if more people insisted on good return policies, I think we'd all feel better about buying new/unavailable tech (since we would have the comfort of knowing that it isn't money flushed down the toilet if it ends up not working for us). I would look for a used one if you are really price-conscious. I bought one used for about $40 under the price of new. You may have to wait a little bit, but it is possible. There is a thread for used ones for sale.

I would look for the thread here that has used devices for sale. Exactly. The A5 (non-X) can sometimes be found at a very decent price, it could be an alternative if budget is important and a more minimalist device can work out fine for your needs, [u/mike\_bike\_kite](https://www.reddit.com/user/mike_bike_kite/)",Information and pricing,title prediction

"Hi,  


I have just watched a [video](https://youtu.be/CXjYHtfDP6A?t=2372) where a PDF, filled with hyperlinks is used almost as if it was an app. I believe this is very similar to the zettelkasten feature which I've read about on the subreddit.

  
This idea got me really excited and upon arriving at the section which shows the PDF on the A5X (which I preordered) it is clearly mentioned and shown that you cannot follow hyperlinks with a single tap. There's always that menu which shows ""Jump To"" which you have to tap again.  
Is it possible to configure this (or change the default) behaviour? If not, I would like to request this :-)  
It should be easy to implement and could very well live alongside the actual zettelkasten feature.

&amp;#x200B;

thanks,

Crucidal [deleted] The inner hyperlinks within the documents are available on Supernote A5X, the prompt of "" Jump to“ ， which designs to avoid unintentional touch which caused to jump to a certain hyperlink page by accident, which might also cause some "" inconvenience"". I agree that there is an inconvenience in both scenarios. However, the touch is not over sensitive and in my experience, being able to hit the hyperlink is enough secure in itself to avoid most unintentional jumping. To me it would be awesome with an option to turn this off, just like you can turn off touch recognition. The power of freedom and customization :) My current experience is purely from e-readers like the kindle paperwhite.(is it fair to assume this would translate to the a5X as well?)I've never experienced unintentional touches there. The palm rejection should ""fix"" other scenarios in which you might accidentally press a hyperlink.It seems like the Jump To was built to prevent ""annoyance"" for a use case that probably rarely happens in comparison to how often you intentionally press it.

Handling unintentional navigation could also be solved by providing a means to quickly go back to the previously shown page. either by a temporarily hovering menu or a built-in shortcut (like double tapping the lower left corner or something)Purely looking at ""handling unintentional navigation"" my suggestion takes 2 page refreshes and that's definitely slower than the ""jump to"" menu. But if you would multiply this by some weight which represents how often you unintentionally navigate vs intentionally, I think it would outweigh the drawbacks :-)","feature request: A5X directly follow internal links without showing ""Jump to"" menu?",title prediction

"Hi r/Supernote. 

&amp;#x200B;

I purchased my Supernote A5X in January and have been using it for a few months now. I absolutely love it. I basically don't use real paper anymore. Over the past several months, my Supernote has become one of my most precious items -- I carry it around with me everywhere. It contains my calendar (actually, Voya's calendar, it's really great!), my todo lists, my personal journal and diary, my work documents, and my school documents and papers. The Supernote team should feel proud that they have created and commercialized such a fabulous device. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to suggest some features, but I don't want to imply that I'm not fully satisfied with the product. The Supernote has brought me alot of joy and I really am happy. In the future, here's what my perfect Supernote device would look like:

&amp;#x200B;

Reading &amp; Note Taking Improvements:

* **Split Screen View.** I wish I could view a document and a note side-by-side at the same time, especially if I turned my Supernote sideways.
* **No annotation tag.** Annotations in PDFs have a small circular ""D"" or ""A"" symbol at the end of each selection that blocks the text underneath. Do we really need these symbols? It would be great to turn them off, or to somehow move them to the side so I can read the text underneath. 
* **Improve the Underlining/Annotating Experience.** When trying to underline a sentence in a PDF, it is too easy to grab (1) the leading whitespace before the first word or (2) the trailing whitespace after the last word or period. It would be great if Supernote was smart enough to omit leading and trailing whitespace characters when underlining.
* **Free the Title.** In a Note, do ""Titles"" really need to be obscured with dark diagonal slashes? What is the point of hiding the text underneath the Title? Perhaps I don't understand this function. Wouldn't it be better if, instead, the text was surrounded by a box that you could see through? Why do I want dark squares in my Note? Why do I want to hide the Title?
* **Change the Lasso Icons.** I feel like the lasso icons are backwards. After I lasso a word or phrase in a Note, the box with a ""T"" in it is *not* for ""Title"" -- it creates a keyword. And the box with ""dots and lines"" is not to create keywords, but to create a ""Title"". I keep getting these mixed up because ""T"" = ""Title"". Am I thinking about this wrong?  I feel like these icons should be swapped, or changed completely.
* **Use UTF-8 Encoding in Digest.** The Digest does no seem to have a full set of UTF-8 fonts. For example, the South Korean won symbol, ₩, does not show correctly in the Digest.

&amp;#x200B;

PDF Improvements:

* **PDF to Note copying.** I want to be able to copy text from an annotation/digest (i.e., the text that I have underlined) and paste it into a Note file.  
* **PDF Snip Tool.** I wish I could lasso an area of a PDF and the copy that over to a Note as an image. 
* **Add Layers to PDFs.** Right now, layers only work in Notes. It would be nice to be able to use layers on top of PDFs. 
* **Copy Written Doodles from PDF to Note.** I wish I could write a little note and/or doodle in a PDF and then cut/copy that into a Note. 
* **Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus.** I want a dictionary and thesaurus feature for PDFs and ePubs (and, Notes?). The Kindle app comes bundled with one, but I can't use that feature outside of Kindle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Potential Bugs:

* **Fix E-mail Typo.** When you enter an incorrect e-mail address (e.g., ""supernote@.com"" is an incorrect e-mail address format) then the error message says ""Please check mailbox"" instead of ""please check e-mail address.""
* **Clean up Keywords.** In a Note, when I lasso a word and mark it as a keyword, it appears as a keyword in the menu. Great. But, when I erase the keyword in the Note, the keyword still appears in the menu. Is that normal? 

&amp;#x200B;

Miscellaneous / Other:

* **Creating geometry.** I want to be able to tap two points on my Supernote device with the pen and have a straight line drawn between them. That's it. That's the feature. I just want to draw straight lines between two arbitrary points. 
* **Creating tables.** I want to be able to tap on my Supernote device with the pen and drag it down to create a table (e.g., a 3x3 or 5x5 or 7x7 table). 
* **Search for Keywords in Digest.** I wish I could search for some text in my Digest (not the notes I make in my Digest, but rather the digest printed text itself). 
* **More Quick Access.** Right now, Supernote only allows 4 Documents and/or Notes in the Quick Access area. I wish I could have a more, especially since adding a 5th document/note completely removes the 1st, and unlinking the 5th does not restore the original 1st. 
* **Quick Access List Reordering.** I wish I could reorder the documents and notes shown in the Quick Access list. But this only makes sense if the documents/notes in the Quick Access area are some how ""sticky"" or ""permanent"". My A5x is scheduled to arrive Monday, and this list looks like a great way to help me get started (in terms of ""things that might not work the way I thought they would""). I hope the supernote team sees this, are they active here? Can you actually ""page"" them so they can be sure to see it? This is a great, carefully considered list of requests and I agree with the vast majority of them.

The biggest one, for me, is the ability to draw straight lines between two points. That would solve a big pain point.

Otherwise, like you, I love this thing. Three months in and it’s now indispensable. Yeah, I use a ruler to draw straight lines, like on pen and paper! xD Super notes does review comments, I was hoping they came out with a calendar with reminders.

Thanks!! Square brackets? These create a separate doc called a digest where you can add your notes relating to that section of the pdf. You click on the text to take you to the digest page.

Received custom import tax payment request via email from DHL on 30. April 7:05 am GMT. Paid right after, process was straight forward. (€129 for Ireland with 23% VAT).

"Hi all

*I posted similar to the below in the remarkable subreddit not realising a5x had a sub.

I'm a Psychologist based in Australia and I'm looking to go digital with my in session note taking. I'm looking for some advice as there's a lot of options.

I think I'm leaning towards the a5x or papyr. I've been watching morning coach and my deep guide most of the morning and it seems that these two devices have improved since release/have good customer service.

How would the a5x go with the below?

Priority
- Note taking/writing is #1 for sure
- Custom note templates (I use a session note template)
- Ability to easily erase what I write
- Ability to export/email my notes to my computer
----- If I could export to a specific folder on my computer that would be ideal
- Ability to create flowcharts/diagrams etc easily as I often use a whiteboard in session

Bonus features
- Would be great if I could export my notes to a specific folder on my computer
- I often put a sticky note on my session note to remind me of things to bring up with the client, but I'm not sure if any device could replicate this?
- Being able to bring up pdfs/highlight and write on them
- Ability to screenshare
- Ability to create a to do list
- Handwriting to text. My hand writing is pretty chicken scratch, but this could be useful in future as I write the same words a lot (so text prediction too)

If anyone has any other suggestions I would be more than happy to hear them. I love my A5X and think it checks off all of your must have boxes and many of your bonus features as well. 

* I really like the writing experience and find it very natural and easy to write on. 
* You can set the note template to be anything you want. There are tons of community created templates and creating custom ones is very simple and straight forward. 
* If you go with the standard or HOM supernote pens, you don't get an eraser button but I don't find it a hassle to switch to the eraser  in the tool bar. I also like the lasso eraser feature a lot and find it easy to use. 
* I have my supernote synced via dropbox. So whenever I choose, all of the files are synced to my computer for reference. You can set up specific folders in dropbox and the files will transfer flawlessly between them. I've never had an easier cloud-syncing experience. 
* I'm not quite sure what you mean by creating diagrams. With Supernote, you are able to draw like you would on a piece of paper. They've hinted at potentially adding drag and drop shapes to notes as well.
* Supernote has several options for marking up and bookmarking documents so you can go back to them later. This might work fo you. 
* You can bring up and write on PDFs. Highlighting is a little strange because its only B/W but it does work.
* Screen sharing is not an option :(
* There are to do list templates and quick access features that make to do lists a breeze to create and update on supernote. 
* I think they are working on handwriting to text for notes but it's not an option yet. 

I cannot recommend supernote enough. I really like the design decisions that Ratta made. The pen loop and aluminum rail system keep the pen and device attached to the folio in a more secure way than magnets do. The writing experience feels great. And the supernote team has been so responsive and listens to the community. This is massively helpful - thank you. You've answered everything so I really appreciate it. I'll have to make though I can avoid using the cloud when it comes to client related notes while still having the ability to export/email them to myself. So I'll ask supernote about that. You can also transfer via usb. 

There is an email function, and I assume that you can send attachments via it (but I haven't used it as I wanted a distraction free device for writing)",Questions on a5x features,title prediction
"Hello Supernote users! I recently updated my Supernote A5X (the day after the newest update came out) and the new features are really great additions. However... the past two days I noticed immense battery drainage. I left my half-charged (give or take) Supernote overnight, waking up to 6%. The day after, left an 85% charged device, only to find it at 55%. Now, this is a HUGE battery drainage problem... and if this is coming from the update, I'm wondering if anyone else had noticed it AND if anyone has considered going down one update for this very reason? As much as I like being able to save my notes as a vector, the last thing I need is my device to feel like my phone, something to constantly be worried about with battery life.

"Hi Can we turn off the jump to request? I have hyperlinked PDF files and I would like to navigate a tad faster by clicking only once?

PS. In love with my A5X xx Our team has discussed this internally. The reason why there is no direct jump is that we lack a shortcut for ""go back"". If the user accidentally triggers the jump, it is inconvenient to return to the previous page. We are developing a convenient way to go back, and at that time, we will enable direct jumps. :) Perfect, thanks ! That's an interesting problem. I know I'm biased here, but I imagine the number of users wanting to go forward with one click far outweighs the number of exceptions of a miss click.

It's just a shame to see videos of the REmarkable clicking through at a high pace for a nice UX feel and the A5X having that friction of double touch...even though you've already built the equivalent capability.

I am being tempted by the Remarkable's texture and pen tool.  Convince me otherwise!

I have ordered the LAMY pen to compare the difference and ordered the Remarkable knowing I can return.  I do a LOT of drawing and my senses are highly sensitive.  I thought I read somewhere about someone who's screen was more textures on. one device than another.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there a way to get a more textured (less slick) drawing experience on the Supernote? Screen protector? Pen?
2. Anyone know if there is a Pencil tool in the works?

(Please know, as much as I am enjoying RM2, Supernote has my heart) No and I don’t know. Just stick with the RM2 if you like drawing. 1.No, you can't add a screen protector because you already have one and you can't remove it because the ceramic pen works with it. For me the first advantage of the ceramic tip is that the tip is thinner.

2) Yes, the pencil brush will be available soon and I look forward to it. The algorithm is done since the beginning of the year, you can see a demo on Supernote's Twitter here :

"I know another one of these threads. I promise I read through as much as I could before posting here but want some fresh perspectives on this given my needs with a device like this.

Both of these devices seem great but I'm torn on which one to get. For my use, I'll only be writing (no drawing or sketching) and I'll primarily be using the device for work meeting notes, to do lists, and daily bullet journaling. I will not use the eReader functionality (already have a Kindle for that) or the PDF viewer/markup functionality. This will be a purely writing device for me. I watched some YouTube videos and both have pros and cons and I can't figure out which one is best for my use. 

The reMarkable 2 looks beautiful and is super thin, which is nice. I also like its UI much better than the Supernote UI - I don't feel like I'll be multi-tasking on a device like this much as I won't be going back and forth between a PDF and notes or anything like that and I don't mind a couple extra presses to get back to my notes (though it looks like rm2's upcoming 2.7 firmware is going to add improved navigation for quickly switching between documents too). The rm2 also has the better OCR, which is something I know I'll use frequently. I already used this often on my Surface to convert handwritten notes. The remarkable 2 also exports writing in a non-rasterized format which is a nice pro. 

The A5X has much better organization options like bookmarks and searching - which would be immensely helpful. The pen is also looking like a huge plus here. I love real luxury pens and own a few fountain pens. So the options Supernote offers are really nice. Plus not ever having to replace the nib is huge and seems like it'd be a nice money save over time. The Supernote also seems to make templates much easier to create and use - which I would for things like my bullet journaling.

My final concerns are price and support. I could use a referral code for the rm2 and get it for over $100 cheaper than the A5X. But I've also heard bad stories of remarkable's support and it's nice to see Supernote engaging with the community. But I also worry that despite that engagement, if something goes wrong I have to send things back overseas which could be expensive or cause long delays (I'm in the US).

Would love to hear the thoughts of people who were trying to decide between the two as well. Especially if you use your device similar to how I described I would above. Thanks! Tough call. Personally, I ended up returning my RM2 and went for the Supernote, see my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/n2ieu3/advice_a5x_vs_rm2/gwyemv3/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Then again, my use case is different.

Why don't you try out the Remarkable and see how you like it? (They offer free returns, after all.)

One thing I'd keep in mind: The writing experience. This is a very personal thing and, personally, I prefer the feeling of the Supernote. &gt; see my comment here

Thanks for that. Helpful. Your points about the areas rm2 wins are also things to consider. Seems like the responsiveness is better. Also the recent 2.6 update seems to have fixed the jagged lines issue on the remarkable. 

&gt; Why don't you try out the Remarkable and see how you like it? (They offer free returns, after all.)

This is a good point. Though I'd feel bad about using someone's referral code only to return the device so they don't get the credit.

Honestly though, if the Remarkable 2 had bookmarks and tags that were searchable it'd probably win for me pretty easily. Though I'd still be lusting after the Supernote's pens and nibs you don't need to replace. I use my device primarily for note taking and planning.  (Consulting on clients). I also purchased both to see which would be better.  SUPERNOTE won.  For me it came to writing, my handwriting needed a .5 and the RM2 was not fine enough and when I switched to the pencil thin, it was too light and hard to read.  As much as I liked the look and feel, it was a deal breaker.  Also, the nib replacement just seemed a hassle.  Love the durability of Supernote.  Supernote can save to cloud or OneDrive which I like, but there is a lot more storage on Supernote than RM2.
Would like to see more “helpful” hints from the company but right now the 3rd party people are doing a nice job for me.
Hope this helps! Thanks. I appreciate this perspective. The pen is a huge reason why I'm still unsure which one to go with. The Supernote's pens all seem superior to anything else on the market - both in feeling like a real pen and also the thinness of the nib. Definitely something I'm putting a lot of weight behind. But so much else about the rm2 seems better for my use cases.",Supernote A5X or reMarkable 2?,title prediction

"Hello Supernote team!  
I just recently purchased a used Supernote device and love the fact that you promote the second hand market for Supernote devices, instead of trying to squash it (I am looking at you Apple!). The ability to buy and sell Supernote devices is amazing because it not only gives a Supernote buying ""*insurance""*  that they can sell the device if it does not work for them, or help those who cannot pay full price afford one, but it also helps keep ewaste out of the landfills.   


That said, while going through the process of finalizing a deal there we were a couple things that concerned/annoyed me though.   
1. Very few rules - Normally anytime you are buying and selling something on Reddit the subreddit has strict rules that help prevent scams. Some of these include recent timestamped photos, addition to the universal scammer list, only allowing payment through paypal goods and services, having the buyer/seller say which state they live in, and a flair that shows how many trades a user has. A perfect example of these rules is r/hardwareswap and r/AVexchange. Implementing some of these rules would greatly help everyone avoid scams.  


2. Hard to find people selling - People who were selling their devices often not only used the trades mega thread but also made new posts or commented on other posts. This caused an issue where it was hard to know if you were seeing all the people interested in selling their devices or not.   


3. Vague price history - Often times the original post showing the final sale price was gone so it was hard to determine what a good deal was or not. Making sure these stay up would greatly help everyone know they are getting a good deal. 

4. Sellers not including screenshots or condition - Most of the time sellers did not include a link to pictures/timestamps of their device so it was hard to detriment what exactly they were selling in what condition.   


Ways to implement these suggestions:  
I think that the best possible way to keep the Supernote market safe and avoid blocking out other content in this subreddit is to create a new subreddit specifically for buying/selling/trading Supernote devices. This new subreddit would then be added to the USL (universal scammers list) and would have strict rules on how people can make posts. Any person who wanted to buy/sell a device could then make a post and the seller/buyer could sort these posts by new in the subreddit getting an up to date list of the resent buying/selling requests. Flairs could be added to further improve the process with Buying, Selling, and Closed tags being used to show the status of a post. Lastly, each post would be able to include pictures and a detailed title so that the buyer and seller can meet quickly and effectively.  


Thanks so much for reading our feedback! I hope this post is helpful. Thank you for sharing your opinion with us, to avoid scams and make our users can get a Supernote device through a trustful channel is our wishes. Hope our users can be more cautious and prudent during the transactions of a used device. What we can do is limited at this stage, look forward to a chance to discuss more with you in the future.

"I've had an issue with my Supernote A5 since I got it almost a year ago and I was wondering if anybody else had the same problem.

I cannot charge the device with a USB-C to USB-C cable. It works fine with the included USB-A to USB-C cable, and with any other A to C cable I've tried. But if the cable is USB-C on both ends (like the MacBook charger) absolutely nothing happens. I've tried this with multiple cables and multiple transformers with the same (lack of) results.

Does anyone else have this issue, or do I have a faulty device? This is frustrating because it means I need a dedicated charger for my Supernote, while the rest of my devices (laptop, phone, keyboard, etc) can all charge from the same cable. If it is a problem with the device, is there any way to get a fix or replacement? Bit surprised you haven't contacted CS if it's been happening for almost a year. I think there were a few customers who had problems with the included cable last year but it can't be that if you've tried multiple cables and chargers. 

Feedback to customer service, via your device, is your best course of action. There are the usual things to try, hard reset, swapping cable around, clean the port (but then you've got it to work with USB-A) etc or it could be a software fault. I'm sure they'll help you resolve your problem I was actually waiting until I got around to getting another cable and adapter to test it out before contacting customer service, and to make sure it wasn't just something about the the USB hardware they use.

I'll contact them, thanks.

I use my Supernote A5 for a lot of grading, and overall it works great for getting feedback to students. I don't use Google Classroom but I can speak to the other aspects of the workflow.

The workflow is a little awkward, however. It's easy enough to get a folder full of PDFs of the student submissions onto the device and to mark them up. But because the Supernote wants to leave the original PDF untouched, you need to export each marked-up document individually (as far as I know there is no way to export an entire folder in one action). This takes usually betweeen 5 and 30 seconds per document depending on its length, which interrupts the grading flow a bit. The exported files are in a totally different directory, named the same as the original document. I usually end up manually copying these files somewhere to be uploaded back to my LMS.

I would **love** it if they implemented an ""export entire folder"" option, or else if there were some way to have the exporting of marked-up PDFs happen automatically in the background.

There might be a smoother workflow with Word .docx files if you get an X-series Supernote.

Still, the Supernote has made marking up student papers and essays *much* easier overall. I no longer need to either (a) print them all out or (b) fiddle with PDF markup on my computer.

Hope this helps a bit! Thank you. This definitely helps! How do your students feel about your comments? Are they able to see and read them easily? Aside from my bad handwriting, yes!

The annotations are a bit pixelated but nobody seems to have had an issue yet. Also, I think the pixelation issue has been solved on the X-series with vector-based exports (which is allegedly coming to the A5 … *eventually*?)",Question about use with Google Classroom/Drive,title prediction
" Hi! Since this morning I’m having a problem when trying to update my a5x, and some more issue. When I try to update it (I’m still at 238 version), through settings&gt;system&gt;software update&gt;check, it just tells me the device is updated. Wifi connection, of course, is on, and I can check my email, but I cannot synchronize though supernote cloud, because when I try, it immediately opens the last doc I read. And finally, if I try to upload the log (system&gt;feedback&gt;upload logs), it tells me “upload failed”. I restart and reboot 3 times, and no variations. Please, give me some indications about what I’m supposed to do. Thanks It should've updated around two weeks ago. My advice is to contact customer service via email and include your device number.

" Thanks a lot! Very good video as always :) I agree with you, it may be missing an option to choose the type of eraser but anyway we will enjoy it ! Just have to be patient for the ""X"" owners. I'm using the 5X this morning, and really miss the erase gesture already! lol Could you tell us if this gesture is possible to execute while holding the device in one hand and writing with the other? Or are you forced to put down the device on your lap or table? I wonder if this specific use case was a part of the troubleshooting when Supernote developed this gesture, u/mulan_sn or u/hex2asc? I've been trying to imitate the gesture on my A6X, but find it a bit difficult to find a natural/working way for two fingers to touch while holding the device in my left hand and the pen in my right hand. The whole premise of the two finger gesture suggests that you have a free hand available in the first place but it's *not impossible* to get two fingers on the screen using the hand holding the device. 

However, as stated from your own trial, it's really awkward and very uncomfortable to get the finger positioning right to successfully activate the function. 

The developers have done a lot of work to refine the gesture and activation zones to prevent as much accidental or false positive activation as possible due to extra stray fingers on the screen including the writing hand making contact with the screen while writing.",Supernote A5 and A6 UPDATE!

"I was just eagerly waiting for my Supernote to be shipped. The long waiting time is not great but is something I understood but I had to cancel my order 3 days before shipping since I looked randomly into the return policy.  Not free return policy and good will return for such devices is just not what I expect. Do you by any chance live in the US?

I read complaints about a lack of free international returns but tbh that's not the norm where I live and, I think, a lot of the world... so calling it *a joke* is a bit harsh and a little US (and maybe EU?)-centric. If I bought a Remarkable, for example, their free return policy wouldn't apply to me since I live in Asia. I guess I would wait for them to set up US/EU warehouses for cheaper shipping in your case.

Edit: The only places I know of here with free international returns are big companies like Lazada (owned by Alibaba; think Amazon) that do logistics in massive volume. How long does this company take to ship? I ordered my A6 X four days ago and have yet to receive a confirmation email. I have only gotten the PayPal receipt. I know they are supposed to have good customer service, but I would at least like to know that my order is being processed. Usually ships within a few days and as far as I remember they sent me a despatch email ( though that doesn't always mean the parcel is physically with the carrier.) I do remember that the tracking was slow to update. See whether anything comes through by Monday then pop them an email to check. Could be they're just busy. Appreciate that we'd all like a free return. However, some people buy it just to try it out, some order at least two devices from different companies with the sole intention of only keeping one. They are a relatively new company, so if a lot of people send devices back, they're losing money. Perhaps, one day they'll be in a position to but likely it could increase the cost for others.

There is the option of selling it, as others have done.

Method 1: Then click the PDF on the cloud page, it will automatically download the exported PDF after clicking and converting (with the .mark files)   
  
Please do not download from the cloud directly without the above steps, otherwise, it is possibly to download the original “blank” pdf without annotations.  
   
Method 2: You can also open/click the exported pdf with annotation from the My device-&gt; Export folders, (The exported pdf will be downloaded automatically)  
  
Additionally，when exporting the PDF on the device, whether you choose “original” or “Vector”. For a vector pdf, If the pdf parsing software cannot open it ( or open without annotation), please try to open it directly with a browser.  
Not sure that whether it is clear enough, please try it. It worked - Thank you!!

Mike I don't have my device yet - it's currently in transit from China. So I can't help you with the first couple. But the pen is not magnetic. They recommend you use the case because it has the pen holder loop on the side for it. 

And as far as I know, the Kindle app only lets you connect to the Kindle service. I'm *pretty sure* you have to use the built in reader to read epub and pdf files you transfer to the device. 1- You don't need the Kindle app to view ebooks. Kindle app is only for accessing kindle books. Supernote can read most ebook formats. Edit: To use LAN, you need the Supernote Partner App.

2- You can put those files anywhere. But the ideal place to do it is in the Documents folder. Putting them in the Notes folder may cause some confusion.

3- Check your email or spam for a privacy or insecure connection alert to enable it.

4- No. You can keep the cap in the pen loop. If you have the standard pen and not HOM, it will be roomy in the pen loop. Many thanks.

Don't suppose you know why the USB won't connect? It seems I can write to the supernote cloud drive and then sync.

"Hello

I have supernote A5x and A6x. I need the two devices to have the same content.

I'm logged in on both devices with the same account (email address). They are not mirroring. on the ratta supernote cloud, it only shows the A6x's content

I've tried to log out and log in on A5x: doesn't work... 

what do I have to do ? Curious about this question myself.  Thinking of getting an A6X for the smaller form factor.  But if they are treated as completely discrete devices and there are no seamless integration options, despite them sharing the same email account, why not consider a non-Sn as a second device just for variety? X series can share the same account(login with one account), while the non-X series can share the same account. You can log in on your new device with your existing Supernote account.  
  
Users need to be careful to keep both devices in sync with each other. Generally, the steps are like following:  
1: A6X writes notes  
2: A6X  sync  
3：A5X sync  
4: A5X writes notes again.  
.......  
Repeat the above steps

I second this. I have an A6X and A5X and they sync with each other fine. Same for me. I have A5X and A6X, and the content syncs fine.

Re Google. Sure it's been mentioned/requested, so believe it'll be possibility in a future update but don't take this as gospel. I work with two devices A5x and A6x, and they can be synced if you what entails correspond to your needs:

1. **Sync is manual, and therefore, not real time**. That means that when you do a change on your device you need to do **every time** you want to use ""collaborative"" documents.
   1. press the sync button on the top drawer, to check if any change has been made since the last sync by someone else
   2. make the changes you need to do
   3. press again the sync button to make sure what on the cloud mirror the content of your device
   4. hoping that no one is doing the same on another device (see 3 below)
2. **Sync does sync the notes but not the ""smart annotation""**. See here point 3, on my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/nnr2nv/do_annotations_exist_outside_my_a5x_or_a6x_device/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). If that's what you need upvote the post linked.
3. **Sync granularity is the file level**, I think, but unsure. I, personally, notice that if I want to sync two devices at the same time, there is an alert on the second one, saying that the cloud is already busy syncing on another device. **What I fear it means is that** : during the time device A is syncing (making some useful changes; let's say to your task list), you can't sync. Then, when the cloud is done syncing A, you start syncing your device B. If, for some reason, the changes you made to the task list on device B is ulterior to the one made on device A, that (probably) means, you'll overwrite changes made by device A, **losing device A changes**.

Based on these remarks, and the fact that you have a team of 8 people (imagine this hassle is x8), **I would recommend going for a device that as a granularity of stroke change, and is in ""real time""**.

If you want to stay in e-inks, I would therefore recommend looking **Mobiscribe Origin: MobiShare**. Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/K35CFZlKC9M) testing the sharing capabilities.

"Thank you for the new firmware update. It adds some very useful features.

Is there any way that you could add pressure sensitivity adjustment/calibration in a future update? I have several styli which I find more comfortable than the Supernote stylus and the default pressure sensitivity is far too high for them. 

Also, in a previous firmware version, the button on a Lamy EMR stylus triggered the selection erase tool when held down. It now does nothing. Can this be re-instated as it was a very useful feature? The eraser on other styli still works fine.

"Since A6X is on Android, I *supposed* we can install Microsoft OneNote app, and take notes directly into MS OneNote.  Supernote, can you please comment if this is possible? Yes, As it's an Android device, you may do that. But you have to wait a few months. At the beginning, we will block any third-party APP until A6X runs stability.

And I should inform you that handwriting latency will increase by using OneNote. Because of slow refresh rate of E Ink Screen, Supernote's note app access the display layer directly. We call this EPA technology (EPaper Accelerator) while OneNote does nothing special for that.

We will not exclude attempts to install third-party applications, and we will establish an application store to encourage users to help us collect applications suitable for ink screens.

For us, our main goal is to develop note-taking application, which needs to be adapted to the disadvantages of gray scale display, low refresh rate and so on. It should perform better than other apps while runs on E Ink Device.

So I think you will have opportunity to try both solutions, from MS or from ours. :) Hi Bruce!

Thanks for the transparent insight :) I agree about your view about the technology and the consumer demands and I hope that your decision will pay off.

One of my concerns with Android as an OS of choice is the latency. Can you say that there will be no decrease in latency (even better, an improvement) with using Android? (The EPA tech sounds great!)

Also, as it is an Android-based software, is it okay to expect some basic functionalities as Web browser, keyboard pairing, etc?

I am really happy that your company is very communicative. Can't wait to join the fam! (would be super cool if you'd have a EU warehouse ;) ) Appreciate the communication and transparency in this.  :)

Perhaps another way for me would be to OCR it in A6X's note taking app, and then export it to OneNote then. This is a good idea!  If we plan to export doc/docx format, why not add one more format as OneNote. We will check that if we can do.",Will A6X be able to sync to Microsoft OneNote?,title prediction
"Is there a reason that Supernote have sent 8 emails about their A6X pre-order offer in the last 30 minutes? There doesn’t appear to be an option to unsubscribe either, which is a bit naughty these days?

Personally, although I really do want to get a Supernote A6X , I’m not going to pre-order anything until I see something a bit more concrete than some screen shots. Not the most thought-out piece of sales literature. Where are the specs, has the latency improved, what are the differences between A6 and A6X...... anything?!  Eight emails,  It's very high treatment. I think they see you as a big buyer. :) We should say sorry, It seems they send everyone 8 emails... It's our mistake.

"Anyone else feel that they are really missing the ability to search for a specific word in their handwritten notes?

I primarily would use this device to take meeting notes. That is the reason Im holding back from buying at this point. SUPERNOTE doesn't have the ability to search hand written notes at this time. However the A6X migth have the ability when it comes out but for mi used I think is too small I need the A5 with that fuction. I really think that constraint is that they don't have OCR readily on their Linux OS (on the other hand, it's one of the main features of the Remarkable). As a consequence, one cannot really map the handwriting to the alphabets for searching..

Prolly also that the software is originally introduced in Chinese/Japanese, so English support is minimal.

Maybe Android will change things as there are lots existing solutions out there. Let's see =) But do you personally feel that you need to search through your notes sometimes? Of course! It's also on my wish list as well. But I could imagine it not being on the top of their priority especially the introduction of the new OS.

"Was quite interested in getting an A5 but was really put off by the fact that there is no way of returning an opened device. I have bought devices in the past that might have worked well for others but just didn't suit me. And so, in less than a few days, they were returned. Given that there is no place for me to try the device, I think it's pretty unfortunate there is no return option. I understand they are a small company that's just starting out but I'd also have been okay if they charged a restocking fee. 

How do you guys feel about their no return policy? Just wanted some different perspectives. I understand your concerns. Our marketing department will internally discuss the return policy in order to better serve our users, especially those early customers who find us. Thank you very much for kind understanding.

As for return policy, we assume Supernote buyers are familiar with E-paper device and operation system and here are reasons we put the policy.

Some customers had impulse buy with less consideration of the need they really want. We would like to avoid such lose-lose result.

We have been suffering by free return policy for some surprising reasons, such as

\- The display size is too small or too big

\- No color display

\- Just dislike it anymore

\- Need some cash back urgent for other

Please understand that we provide one-year warranty with free replacement and DHL delivery for obvious malfunctions or defects as a responsibility to customers, but we cannot afford for nonsense return. We fully understand that most customers are reasonable and kind, but things keep happening. We are a young company doing all we can to improve our product for people's daily lives.

We know this is never a cheap purchase so we appreciate every customer who places order and uses Supernote to make daily life more efficient and meaningful as our 4F slogan: Feel &amp; Find, Free &amp; Fun. It’s not great, especially when they are expecting customers to purchase, at least at the moment, based on a “goodwill” policy, in that there is hardly any info at all available on the A6X. 
I dunno about anyone else, but I would always try and get as much info as possible on something that was going to cost me several hundreds of pounds, but that info isn’t available. I really do understand that there will be timewasters, people who don’t like the colour, etc, but you’d like to think those were in the minority. The point made about a restocking fee seems fair, perhaps something along the lines of even half the purchase price, so it would sting if you sent it back,(for non-defect reasons, obviously ), but wouldn’t be a complete loss for either side?
I’m waiting for two things before purchasing the A6X, one is more information, videos, specs etc and the other is a European distributor so I don’t end up having to pay a third of the price in shipping and taxes! That's a really disappointing reply that I think you copy/pasted from somewhere else in this thread or your website (so no real discussion?). I have mentioned maybe even instituting a restocking fee to discourage frivolous returns from customers. You haven't addressed that. None of the examples you mentioned (why people return devices) capture the writing experience, that's the one thing we can't test by watching videos. ""the no returns due to a small percentage of potentially bad customers"" approach doesn't reciprocate the goodwill you seem to be expecting from your customers. 

Anyhow, you guys are allowed to run your company however you think is best and I wish you all the best for that.",No returns on opened devices?,title prediction

" Thanks, good share.  I understand Mandarin (Chinese) so here are some takeaways:

Looks like there are some interface changes on the tool bar and also the way the notes are displayed.

10:40 - The Lamy pen feels the same as the 1st generation heart of metal pen (Plastic nib). The reviewer said there's a bit of ""stickiness"" feeling when writing.  He feels that the 2nd generation ceramic nib feels better when writing. 

12:20 - He was comparing the Weixin ebook reading app, I think.  He mentioned the speed seems to be comparable with another ebook reader and looks nice.  Chinese Font on the A6X seems to be smaller and doesn't seem to have a setting to change that in the Chinese ebook reader app he is using.  

13:37 - He mentioned the writing experience is quite good.  Will be continuing further reviews as he uses the A6X in the coming weeks. Thanks so much! I received one. 
I can do a quick video if that helps.

Can confirm the stickiness of the Lamy nib, don’t have ceramic to compare. 

Shout your questions and I’ll answer :) Thanks! :)  Can you please share your experience of the ebook reading?  Things I'm looking at:

\- Table of content

\- Annotations: is it easy (just write directly?)

\- Can you export annotations easily?

\- Can you still draw a line across the screen and then do note taking split screen?

\- Press-and-hold on a word for dictionary (is it available yet)?

"I have a Onyx Boox with note taking from work, but the A6X appeals to me.  However, I've found it very hard to make pencil-like sketches due to the lack of pressure sensitivity to opacity on the Onyx.  Though the brush gets thinner with low pressure, it's still 100% pure black.

Most of the first pre-orders have been shipped and many customers in Japan, China, Europe and the U.S. have already received the A6 X. We look forward to you sharing your creations on the A6 X!

1. The region selection edit tool affects the erasing effect.

2. Margins are too large (EPUB)

3. Confusion caused by two different entrances, the right tag bar and the file manager.

Personally, I want to have one of those eink device to take notes at work, read epub pdf and blogs. So the only think really missing on A5 is the browser.

Any thoughts on that?

For the A5, it is harder to integrate a browser, but out of concern for our users, we will try out as many solutions as possible, without guaranteeing results. If the browser is crucial to you, ""X"" series could be a better option at this stage.

"Hi, I've just updated my A6X with the C.063 firmware. Thank you for the correction on the selection tool after the erasing action. It works. 😊

I wanted to tell you I found the following bugs:

- Eraser: with the previous version, when I chosed the ""region eraser"" or used the eraser on the Lamy pen I could delete just a part of a continuos stroke, just the area I selected. With the update I can only erase a complete stroke, even if I select just a part of it. And if I choose the ""regular eraser"" I cannot change its thickness, even if I go to ""pen"", change its thickness and then ""regular eraser"", it is always small.

- Folders: I still find the confusion we had on the previous version, but now I know that if I want to see the files stored in a folder I have to use the side bar, go to Inbox and then select the folder I need. It would be just great if I could see my files even if I choose for example ""Documents"" or ""Notes"" on the side bar and then select the correct folder.

- Png: I don't know why, but when I select a png file, the device tells me ""Unsupported file format"". I can see the thumbnail, but can't open it. It happened also with the previous version.

I know you are working hard on further updates, so maybe you are able to add some of these amendments.
And thank you for this amazing device! Hey there,

Thank you for your detailed feedback.

Eraser: To improve user-friendliness, we are optimizing the region erasing algorithm for a smarter approach.

Folders: in this release we have only tweaked the UI to reduce confusion and will bring subsequent improvements in later updates.

One option to go around this problem is to use the star mark. You basically draw a star on a page and the device recognizes it. After, you can search for star marks in any note document you have and it will display small sized pages where you have a star. Therefore, if you underline some important keyword on a page with one of these marks, you can find that word with no problem. So it's still better than a regular paper notebook. Also consider that you don't have to use paper or carry tons of notebooks with you. Everything is in one device. It is fast, good to write on, and everything is tidy and accessible.
I have been using A5 device everyday for roughly a month now. I use it as a notebook and (mostly) as a PDF reader. Besides the very good writing experience, fast processing, etc., the best part is that I don't use paper anymore and everything is cleaned and organized from the beginning. I would recommend it.
That being said, if you really need a handwritten notes conversion function and don't want to tackle the problem by the means that supernote offers, there may be other devices on the market more suitable for you. Yes, we have the same idea as you. So we made a similar function in A6X. My colleague will post a video later, please confirm if this is what you want.

Once this function is approved by our users, we will apply it to A5/A6. Hi there, you can convert your handwriting to text and set it to keywords for easy searching and indexing.

"Do you guys think that this would be possible? I use OneNote for **a lot** of things and it would be so awesome if SuperNote could sync with them. :-)

I thought of this after my integration with Dropbox completely broke on my A5. Maybe another idea would be to add more slots for quick access? I keep a lot of my notebooks separate and having more than 4 items in the quick access bar would be a gamechanger for me. If this feature comes through Supernote would make an immediate impact on the professionals market (potentially grabbing a chunk of it from iPad). I see OneNote used in the industry a lot, yet very few who use it write up the notes on iPad. In my area we use ordinary notebooks and then retype the notes in OneNote (it is considered unprofessional to type notes in a customer meeting). If I had this sync - that would be the feature I'd be using hte most.  


The key thing though - it should support the corporate sharepoint accounts somehow (OneNote can use sharepoint as the sync backend). Completely agree! None of these devices have that functionality so it would really cater to a very specific target market. Posted this sometime back.  They replied:

"I have had a Supernote A5 for close to two months now, and overall I love it. It has changed the way I work and has made me much more productive.

 However I have been surprised at the poor quality of the images in exported notes. It seems like they export as raster images at the same resolution as the Supernote screen. When I view them on a larger, higher-resolution computer screen the lines look very jagged and pixelated, and zooming in on a note makes this worse (see the attached doodle).

Is there a reason that Supernote does not export to PDF with a vector-based image, like I believe the reMarkable does? I believe this would help the notes look much more legible and clear when read on a computer.

"I wish to use one for home and another for work, but would like both to sync from the same Dropbox account.

I mainly use notes and would like notes to sync on both devices. Interesting question. How do you think the sync should work? My understanding of the sync process is that it doesnt sync unless i explicitly pulldown then top nav bar and hit the sync button.

So, for simplicitly/Minimum Viable Product, i think they should let the end users control sync i.e. if there is a sync conflict (i.e server file updated by another device), they provide the option to a) retain file on device, overwrite on server (cloud) b) retain file on server, overwrite on device. Yes,you can.
And one more thing need to know is that  a6x is trying a new note file format which differently with ""none x"" series(A5,A6). So if you sync one of A5/A6 type with another of A6X type. Each one would fail to open the note file created by another.

"Just got the A6X today and I have to say that as a person who much prefers pen over pencil, it is really nice to write with. I've had the rM1 for about 4 months now and here's my initial thoughts comparing the two. (Background - I'm part designer and researcher and I make things with my hands so I'm very sensitive to the tools I use)

Screen - I thought that the A6X's 300dpi screen would mean that the lines I write would be less pixelated and smoother-looking than the 226dpi of the rM tablet but that's not the case. 

Size - I thought the smaller 7.8"" diagonal screen size would feel like I'm losing out on screen real estate. I don't feel that way because of the finer tip on the pen. The size is more portable than the rM dimensions and I feel like I can take it everywhere with me.

Pen - It's a comfortable weight to write with. The style reminds me of the Pilot Razor Point felt tip pen that I used to use a lot. The finer nib and the feeling that I can press as hard as I need to is mentally relieving. I did not realize how hard I write until I've switched back to pen and paper after using the rM1. The standard rM1 marker feels to me like trying to write with a hollow plastic tube. I also have the LAMY AL-Star and that feels too bulky for my medium-large hand with skinny long fingers. Sometimes when I press the button on it a short line appears out of nowhere on the rM1. I don't have any mods on my rM1.

Writing feel - Wow. Everyone's been saying it's hard to describe. Here's my attempt. My go-to paper for writing is very smooth, about 25% of the way to glossy paper, and I usually use the Muji retractable pen, the one that looks like the Sarasa retractable pen, 0.5mm. It's a ballpoint. Compared to that, writing on the A6X is like if the ballpoint is not rolling, but instead it's gliding. The sound of writing is quieter than the rM, which is quieter than pen on paper. It sounds like you're writing on paper with a smooth paper texture, but that's if you're writing with a light hand. The harder you press down, you'll get less of that scratchy sound. When you first put the pen to the A6X screen, you'll hear a tap sound kind of like Apple Pencil on iPad but quieter. It's louder if you're holding the pen at an angle, and quieter if you're writing on it such that the pen is tangent to the surface (or orthogonal or uhhh straight down for the laymen terms). The rubber texture provides more resistance the harder you press when writing. If you press too hard, it's a lot of friction. But that means that you get more haptic feedback if you're going slow and trying to be precise in your lines. If you're pressing hard and want to write fast, it's gonna feel like too much friction. On that note, I can see the indent of the lines on the screen surface when I write hard and it quickly disappears. So that's good. 

Colors - the A6X has 4 colors. White, light gray, dark gray, and black. I don't see myself using the white one very much. Compared to the rM1 which has white, gray, and black (and light gray for highlighter), this means that I can use the A6X for planning website layouts. Light gray would be content boxes and then darker gray can be non-text content. I would fill in actual content with black. 

Switching between tools - It's nice that it's only one tap to switch to the highlighter or marker(?) on the A6X. On the rM1, this requires two taps and then reading from the list to pick what you want to use. Unless you've got the positions all memorized. For me, this means that it is faster to write headings and highlight important content so that I can structure my notes clearly and visually. 

Interface and some features - It's not as obvious how to get to the Settings menu like on the rM interface. You have to know to swipe down from the top and the mini tutorial at the beginning does not cover that. I love the lasso select text as a heading for a table of contents. That way, I don't have to look through the pages to find what I'm looking for. Compared to the rM1, this means that I will not have to create a new notebook for each topic or subtopic. I can just select the text to be a header. 

Cover - I got the default cover. The front cover feels a bit too lightweight and it wiggles around easily. I can see where the round magnet is on the inside of the front cover, which is not a problem. 

Questions - 

1. I'm trying to sync with Dropbox. There's no new folder on my Dropbox or I can't find it. Do I need to have a Supernote account for this to work? I'm hoping I don't need that. 

2. I'd like to use the nib in a different pen chassis. I was able to unscrew the front piece near the tip but can't seem to get the nib out. Can I even do that with this updated ceramic version?

3. I made a test notebook that's just 2 pages of scribbles. Why is it 2MB? I like that it does tell me how big the file is but I imagine if I have 100 pages, it may be 100MB. So about 2000 pages would be 1GB. So the 22GB of user space I have on the A6X would give me like 44,000 pages. Much less than the rM's advertised 100,000 pages on 8GB. 3. I wrote about the file size as well and the support team replied saying that they will fix that issue in future updates. They said that they are well aware of the issue and they have a potential fix that will be part of one of the future updates. 
Hopefully that future update will be before you reach the 44,000 page limit? Lol just kidding 😅 

Enjoy your A6X, I think its a marvelous tool with an equally amazing &amp; very active team behind it. Cheers. Thanks! Glad they’re going to fix the issue. 

I quite enjoy it so far, much more than I have enjoyed my rM1 in the past months. I think I may have found the right one for me. To read your notes in Dropbox, first export them als pdf or png.

"Had a quick question-what type of charger is recommended for charging my A6X to have better battery life. I read in Onyx Boox posts that fast charging was causing lot of battery issues. 

Is it ok to charge my A6X with a fast charger? Or should it be a small charger? Or a computer perhaps (as the package did come just with a cable and no plug 🔌) 

Want to keep my Supernote for ever 😁 A6X support USBPD (the main fast charge standard). It's a negotiation protocol. When plugged, the charger will ask A6X, ""how much current you want?"", and A6X always answer,""1.5A is enough"". So the charger will start supply current limited by the agreement. You need not worry about too much current would damage the device. Typically A6X will get full charged in 2 hours by a 7.5W (or more powerful) PD charger. 

If you want to use a fast charger, please make sure it's PD type.

It's also ok if you use a computer USB port for charge, it will take more time than PD charger, at about 3-6 hours. Because of computer USB port usually limit the current supply at 0.5A-1A level. Perfect explanation! Thank you",Type of Charger to Use,title prediction
"Hi! Question for the supernote team, after the holidays. 

Are any of the following features on the roadmap? (I understand the hardware roadmap is delayed for bug squashing and UI integration across devices, so it could be a while, but would love to know if they’re at least in the works or in planning.)

1. Frontlight (ability to set brightness at the least, ideally also warmth)
2. Waterproof/water resistant

3. Work with calibre wirelessly* (content server or companion app)


* actually, as I’m still having trouble getting my A5 set up to work with my PC at all via usb cable, I’m not 100% sure it works with the calibre desktop software that way. Does it? If not, that’s definitely a feature request, too.  


Thanks! Our holiday is coming to an end, but I have been on duty during the holiday

1. About the front-light.

When the E Ink screen was first put on the market, it was necessary to add an auxiliary light source due to the low contrast. However, the current contrast gets better and does not require front-light. In products whose main purpose is note-taking, removing the front-light is a common way.

However, some brands with a history of making eReaders continue to use front-light. The reason is that it can be used in places without lights, such as at night. My question is why not turn on the lamp?

Our focus is on a good handwriting experience, writing on a shiny screen will not be an enjoyable experience. 

We use the ""hard pen and soft film"" technology to simulate the effect of paper. If the front-light layer is added, the distance from the pen tip to the display layer will increase. So we would rather give up the front-light feature.

2. About waterproofing

We will not use waterproofing on the ""X"" series (A5X/A6X), but we will consider supporting waterproofing on the successor products of the ""non-X"" series

3. About USB

If you use MAC PC, you need to install the software openMTP to support USB connection. If it's not cause by this, please contact our customer service. Thanks for another quick and thorough reply. I’m consistently impressed by your presence in this subreddit.

1. I sometimes like to work and to read in bed while my spouse is asleep. That said, yes, I could leave the bedroom or perhaps use a smaller external book light. That’s a great point about adding a light lessening the writing experience.

2. Interesting, thanks!

3. It’s a laptop running Windows 10. I’ll do a bit more troubleshooting on my end and then reach out if I still can’t figure it out.

Thank you again. I enjoy this work because I like to communicate with others, especially for interesting idea to make product better. Another reason is I want to improve my English skill since I'm from the place where the mother language isn't English.

I'm happy to learn a new phrase ""reach out"" from your message.

So don't be hesitate to reach out with any question:) &gt;Our focus is on a good handwriting experience, writing on a shiny screen will not be an enjoyable experience.

I totally understand this, but the device can \*also\* be used for reading: and improving the reading experience in low light setting can be nice, don't you think so? It would also improve the perceived contrast of the screen (that's the magic behind the ""paperwhite"").

Eink screens did improve, but the background is still kinda grey. With an optimal lighting and a document with good contrast it's fine, but if that's not the case a frontlight can help. A lot. If it can be shut down, what problem would it create? Is the distance to the display layer so big that the writing experience would be really different?

"My boss was enamored enough of my A6X to buy one for herself, and for her birthday I got her a Heart of Metal pen.  She loves it, so here's a review:

""The pen is STURDY.  I don't feel like the cap is going to pop off if I drop it.  It makes a solid ""click"" when snapping it back on and I love that it's thicker than the standard pen because I prefer writing with wider barreled instruments.  It writes just as perfectly as the standard pen.  No charging required.  I don't know how long the nib will last but the packaging included easy instructions for changing it and I've had the standard for months without any degradation so I don't expect to be changing it any time soon.   Fits snugly on the case's loop and I don't worry about it coming off in my bag."" 

So obviously she gives it 5 stars, lol!  I'll be buying one for myself eventually if I get tired of the LAMY one. Totally agree; I also have the HoM pen, bought it along my A5. It solves the problem I had with my previous eink notepad; as an university student, I write a lot and the nibs would wear off way too fast. Now I can write probably till the end of the world :D So happy.

"I just got both of these delivered today I was in batch 3 for the remarkable 2

Here are my observations as a notebook doodler. I wanted a device that I could take outside and do some sketching and people studies and just generally be able to do rough logo concepts and first stage illustration layouts, like I usually do in my paper notebook. I am a biro scribbler rather than pencils so... here are my observations.

Surface feel - the biggie :) well remarkable has this won hands down. You start drawing on this and you just smile. Man it really does feel and sound like you are drawing on paper. It is absolutely incredible. The supernote definitely doesn’t feel like paper it feels like writing on rubber or a piece of Lino with a biro, as you press harder you can feel the pen almost carving into the surface. It doesn’t feel bad but it definitely doesn’t feel like paper. So if you are just looking for the most realistic paper feel then go get the remarkable 2

Drawing experience - the remarkable 2 has a large range of pens pencils and a brush. The supernote only has three  - fine liner, the pen (pressure sensitive), and the marker. The remarkable brushes all differ in the types of marks that they create and I have not yet found an absolute favourite but the brush seems very versatile lots of variation between thick and thin strokes and the biro mimics it’s real life counterpart rather well. The pencil is ok and uses tilt for shading but for some reason you can only choose one colour (black). 

Due to the smaller selection on the supernote the choice is pretty easy the pen works the best for me due to the pressure sensitivity and mimics fairly well the results that I get when I am sketching with a biro, I usually use lighter (thinner) strokes for initial forms and then lay down harder (thicker) stroke for final forms this technique also works well here. I hope that supernote include more ‘pens’ soon. I would love a brush that lets you lay down thicker strokes to make full use of the pressure sensitivity. The stylus sensitivity and lag on both are very good, perhaps the remarkable edges it here, but the supernote is very very good too.

Colours (greys) - the remarkable includes only three shades for their ‘pens’ - black, mid grey and white - with the exception of the pencil which as mentioned is only available in black. There is also a highlighter which lays down a lighter grey which is handy. It is also worth mentioning that the highlighter is translucent rather than opaque so you can still see your artwork behind it and the colour gets darker as you lay down subsequent strokes (like a real world marker pen) The supernote includes four colours for each tool - black, dark grey, light grey and white, but doesn’t include a translucent highlighter.

Erasing - where the supernote definitely outshines the remarkable 2 is in its erasing capabilities which you wouldn’t think would be a big thing, but it kinda is. I find it very difficult to see the eraser line on the remarkable and you only see what you have erased when you finish your stroke, so you’re never quite sure what the result is going to be, there seems to be quite a bit of trial and error as to how much of the stroke is erased, which is annoying if you are trying to erase precisely for highlights etc. If you are just using one layer then you can ‘erase’ using a white colour for any of the pens, but if you want to put a shadow layer beneath your main artwork then it kinda messes everything up because you have white opaque ink on the layer above. Supernote on the other hand nails this, the eraser works the same as the brushes, it erases instantly so you can be very precise. Obviously in real life you don’t have multiple layers in your paper notebook but thought it was worth mentioning.

Screen refresh - the remarkable leaves quite noticeable ghosting behind on darker inked areas when you close the tool sub palettes, and I don’t think it’s possible to do a manual screen refresh, although switching a layer visibility off and on seems to do the trick. I haven’t encountered these issues on the supernote but if I did you can swipe up on the sidebar to refresh the screen which is nice.

Size and portability - the remarkable is about the same size as an A4 piece of paper. So the equivalent of an open a5 notepad which is what I usually have in front of me in front of my keyboard when I’m working, so it’s a nice size, to scribble down some sketches or client notes when at work. The supernote may be a little small to jot down a lot of notes or sketches and it is not currently possible to zoom in to the canvas, but is absolutely ideal to pop in your bag and do some al fresco doodling. Another thing to note is that the remarkable 2 has a landscape mode but the supernote doesn’t. So if you are drawing in landscape orientation the toolbar is rotated 90 degrees

Overall feel - I preordered my remarkable 2 and just got the vanilla options so standard pen and sleeve only. So that cost around USD399 plus shipping The supernote a6x was USD 369 plus shipping but the real kick in the pants was the 20% extra you pay on import taxes. So these two devices were practically the same price. 

But when you handle them the remarkable feels like a luxury item and the supernote feels like a fun friendly gadget. I wouldn’t think twice about throwing the supernote in my bag and whipping it out to do some urban sketching, but the remarkable 2 feels a lot more precious and feels like it would be a lot more conspicuous in public places

From a pure sketching point of view it’s difficult to choose between the two. The pen performance on both is equally as good. The sheer size and paper feel make the remarkable great for cracking out development sketches and making  longer form notes at home or the office. The only thing putting a dampener on the experience is the eraser functionality. The size of the supernote makes it very portable and great for urban sketching, single sketches, and shorter notes/lists.

I’m enjoying them both and not sure which will get most use but I have a feeling that I’ll take the supernote everywhere with me, and use the remarkable primarily at my desk or on the sofa.

In summary

Remarkable 2

===========

\+ feels like writing on paper

\+ Premium feeling/looking product

\+ Pen performance is great

\+ Landscape mode

Eraser isn’t very good

Some screen refresh artefacts

Maybe a little conspicuous for urban sketching

Supernote a6x

===========

\+ Great size for urban sketching

\+ Free folio cover and pen

\+ Pen performance is great

\+ More shades of grey to choose from

\+ Eraser works well

Feels like biro on rubber not paper

Fewer tool to choose from

No zoom

No landscape mode

Maybe too small for development sketches or extensive notes

Hope that helps any doodlers out there Thank you for bringing a so fair and so detailed comparison.

After I read it carefully, I will follow your article from the role of product participant. This is such a great review. Very detailed. I especially agree with you on the size of the A6x. I find myself bringing it everywhere with me because of its size. Great review!

Another point I notice about the Supernote. The bottom end of the pressure curve has no opacity pressure. Only size. So the stroke gets smaller, and then just stops at a certain pressure activation.

On Remarkable, a light touch with the pen has a slight opacity falloff, like a real pen. The pencil even more so. So you can get a lighter half-textured stroke.

But even the Remarkable pen pressure curve doesn’t go to zero. It snaps off at a certain pressure. So if you try and draw an extremely light line, it snaps on and off like a dashed line.

I’d love if both these tablets had a complete drop off to zero on the pressure curve. It would make drawing much better. But with Remarkable, it has a slight edge because it has a bit of opacity falloff too.

Both feel nice though, and I enjoy drawing and writing on both.

Also, sometimes I use the Remarkable stylus on the Supernote. The plastic nib glides very nicely over the rubbery surface! And the stylus is lighter than the Heart of Metal stylus, so it’s a bit easier on my wrist after a while.  Supernote was originally designed for note-taking, so we made HoM into the same shape and weight as a traditional pen.

But when it comes to art, the lighter the better. So we're going to make a special pencil for the artist. It can also be used in other situations. And compatible with all Supernote tablets. This pen will be the default accessory for A5 SLIM, but users can purchase it separately.

"I haven't ordered an A6X yet,  was really hoping for an A5X soon.  I was wondering it anyone is able to test the Trello app for functionality and if it doesn't work is life to put in s request for it. Hello, thank you for your information, we have recorded your request. Could you please describe your use case? I am an engineering consultant. I create buckets for each of my clients and then create cards for each project I'm working on. Inside the cards I add notes from calls, task lists, setup a timeline that gets added to a calendar, etc. Once a project is done I will move the card to Client-Archive bucket. I would suggest you look at getting a regular tablet, like an iPad with a paperly screen protector instead to get a paper-like feel. I don't think this device or other eInk devices can properly support that work flow.

If you want just a Kanban board I'd understand. You could definitely draw up a Kanban template. But a fully functional Trello is excessive for these types of devices. 

Additionally, Trello doesn't support handwriting, so you would be typing everything out anyways, which will be a way slower experience due to eInk. 

Take Onyx Boox for example. They just use fully open android so you can install anything you want. But the performance of the app won't be any good for it. Since they have no control over a third party-apps, nothing can be done other than wait for an upgraded model that can handle it.

"After updating to the most recent A5 software here are some of my thoughts about the changes made to the top menu bar for note taking.

Moving the page number display position in notes to the top menu bar to prevent accidental touches was a definite improvement for my daily workflow. However I feel that the user interface design of the top menu bar still needs a bit more refinement, as I have now lost easy access to a lot of my regularly used menu items such as share &amp; export, templates, and quick access.

I think too much unnecessary space is being taken up by the note/document title (50% or more of the screen width) and the page navigation. By reducing the size of the space and decreasing the font size of the text for the titles, I think at least 3 or 4 of the other more commonly used menu items can be restored to the primary top menu instead of being relegated to the secondary drop down menu list instead.

Curious to know others opinions on the new top menu redesign for the A5. Which menu items do you often use that are now part of the secondary menu options (ooo)? 

Is there any way to customise which menu items are more important for inclusion in the primary top menu by prioritising the items in the same way that tag menu items are ordered in the settings menu?

As always thanks for the regular updates and feedback on questions and issues posted by users. Malcsweb, have you tried to simply double tap anywhere on the screen to hide all menus?  This gives you full screen real a state for writing or document viewing. Thanks but the issue is not about trying to hide menus for writing/reading but suggesting to get rid of empty white space in the title and page navigation section of the NEW top menu to make room for more menu options that used to be there previously. Thank you for your thoughts, this is very helpful. What do you think about the user interaction design of the A6 X? We have piloted a new user interface on the A6 X. The top menu has been redesigned based on the frequency with which users access different menu items. We are still working on this interface and plan to unify the A5, A6 Agile and A6 X once it is complete. Thanks Supernote\_official. Haven't seen the A6X design in detail but from what you described I like the idea of top menu items based on frequency of use. Look forward to seeing this feature in future updates.

1. I have never used the Kindle app before and I don t quite understand it.

I also find out that you can buy kindle books for 3rd party shops. I am not interested in the market aspect of it, because there are not many books in my language on their platform, but is there a reason to choose the kindle library over the default Supernote library (the tablet's interface itself)?

2. I just found out about the titling feature of the tablet, but can I use it for PDF s text (lasso -&gt; transform into title)? If not, how could I insert titles that could be recognized by the tablet if we are talking about a PDF that I created? 

3. Because I didn t find a solution to the .2 question, I am using bookmarks. Can i change the ""title"" of the bookmark? Long press doesn t work.

4. I just saw that .word format is available (I don t know if it was available before) and that a lot of functions were implemented for it, especially the zoom function. I was quite sad that I can t zoom in my PDFs, but I found out about the trimming feature for the PDFs files. This is like a zoom, right? Does it have another function?

1. kindle app is used to read the ebooks only from kindle store. 

2. We support the handwriting title to make the note file structured and indexable. because many user's note increased to dozens of pages, they need a easy way locate the page quickly. We will not support this feature on PDF/DOC. Because PDF/DOC has own methods such as cross-reference, you can jump to the page from the cross-reference.

"Just following up with a question I saw someone else had. A major use case for me to buy into an e-ink note taking device is to be able to skip a step when taking notes. The conversion of my handwritten notes to text that I can eventually turn into more coherent documents. Is handwriting to text in the pipeline for implementation? It's a fashion. But according to our test, handwriting recognition will limit the fun and freedom of notes, and even slow down the writing speed (in order to ensure the recognition rate). So we will support this feature, but the priority is not high. And handwriting recognition will first be applied in some partial features, such as keyword recognition, and the text insertion in the doc revision function that will be released in the next update. The function of ""entire handwriting recognition and import into DOC/TXT"" will be implemented at the end.

This is not a technical problem, but a difference in product concepts. That's good to know it is something that can be implemented. Thank you for actually responding, even if I am disappointed in the answer.

But wouldn't that improve the functionality and fun of a note taking device? I don't think it has to be done simultaneously, but if I'm using the supernote  to take notes during an interview, a meeting, or a lecture, which seems like a pretty common use-case, it would so helpful to be able to export my handwritten notes afterwards into a text document. I don't think it has to be live. It could even be something you schedule to do when the device isn't being used. It would add a practical element to something that is fun! 

For example. As part of an ideation process, I could be brainstorming something on my device, have it exported to an md, docx, or txt file, share with a colleague for feedback, and then I could review/annotate it back on my device. It would just eliminate a step of doing a manual conversion!

If it isn't a technical problem, you could implement it in a way that fits with your intentions for the devices. But if Nova and other note-taking eink/tablet can do it, its a bit unfortunate this one chooses not to. Especially when your devices seem to offer such good features in other ways! It seems like the devices are so close to what I want, and I may still buy one, but not having this available in the foreseeable future is a reason not to jump in, yet.

Either way, thanks again for replying and being transparent, even if I don't agree. Until I can justify a device, I wish the team continued success! If you output TXT/DOC in a calm environment, you will find the keyboard is the most efficient.  If you take notes in interviews or meetings, you will find that your writing needs to keep up with other people's speeches, which leads to scribbling.  Some sketches are even mixed in to make the description more intuitive.  These all increase the difficulty of identification.  If you have really used similar software, you will find that the effect may not be as good as you think.  We are not opposed to full text recognition.  We just tend to accumulate some assistive technology and then do this.  For example, how to distinguish between sketches and characters. Because once we start to do this, we must ensure that it is really effective, not just a marketing video in an ideal state. Yes indeed a keyboard would be more efficient, but for many reasons, not always viable. Hence a note-taking device can fill the need. It's good point that hand notes tend to also include sketches or special characters, like those in mathematical equations or flow charts or cluster maps. It is reassuring that it seems that there is a focus on delivering a clever bit of software as the goal. However, you did say earlier that it wasn't technically difficult. So now I'm confused.

Either way, it seems this functionality will be added, perhaps more in the future, but when it does, I think your software and products will become a lot more attractive to people like me, or academics, analysts, jotters, or creatives. The original point of my question was whether it was in the roadmap of functionality. I'm glad to see it is, disappointed it isn't as much of a priority, so now I'm hoping that when it does become a feature, that it was worth the wait",Handwriting to text,title prediction
"Hello guys! I'm wondering if A6X can handle pdfs (scanned books) well. I'm a bit worried about the screen size. I heard there's crop function but is that enough to read small texts?

How's your experience?

(p.s. eagerly waiting for the A5X) I am reading now on some material that I wrote in Times New Roman 12, double spaced, and with the crop function it s good. It was readable even without the crop function (I discovered it later).

The only part that I don t like about the crop function is the fact that it takes the ""note space"" away, but I believe you can ""\[ \]"" and make notes inside that - look into the user manual for this. 0:46 - PDF articles.

"It would be wonderful to be able to borrow free ebooks from my public library right from A5. I know other linux based e-reader devices can do this, e.g. Kobo.  I wonder if other A5 users would like this feature?  And....Is there any chance that Ratta engineers can integrate Overdrive or Libby into the A5 platform. OverDrive seems only support  ios/android. So you may get other resource, such as gutenberg project.  [https://www.gutenberg.org/](https://www.gutenberg.org/)  You may download the ebooks from the website and than transfer to your A5. Thank you hex2asc.  I appreciate your prompt reply.  I will try this.  

But, please allow me to ask another question.  I am not a programmer, so my knowledge is very limited in this area.  And I probably don’t know that I don’t know.   Nevertheless, when I was researching e-ink tablets, I selected the A5 because of the stability of Linux OS, which runs my wonderful A5.  I understand that Kobo e-readers also run on Linux.  How can they incorporate Overdrive, and not the A5 if hey are both on the same platform?  Is it because e-readers are fundamentally different from e-ink tablets? You like to ask why, which makes me have to check the usage of OverDrive.

I found that Kobo has developed an interface specifically for OverDrive, so Kobo can directly connect to OverDrive to browse and read eBooks. But for other eReaders, there will be some complexity, Users need to install the software ADE (Adobe Digital Editions) on PC/Mac . We can to vist the OverDrive website by PC browser, and then download the eBook, and then transfer the book to the e-reader.

We have not tried to connect to ADE,  we will learn more and try. I am grateful that you looked into it and even considering the request.  Best wishes.",Feature request: Overdrive on the the Linux A5 platform.,title prediction
"Is A6X more abrasive than Oynx on the pen? If I use the same pen (Lamy Al Star) on both of them, will the nib wear be the same? I am not sure about the nib wear, but i believe the nib you would use on both devices are different. Due to the surface coating on the A6X, the nib is harder compare to the nib you would use for Onyx.  


So if you do reuse a pen between the two devices, you would have to swap nibs before using. Thanks for the answer. Is it possible just to buy the nib for A6X from somewhere? Supernote devices have a built in screen protector that is much more pliable than Onyx (or any other e ink device).  The pen that comes with Supernote devices has a ceramic tip that never needs to be replaced.  It can only be used with Supernote devices - if you use it on any other type of device it will scratch the surface.

You can also get an upgraded package from Supernote that includes a Lamy Al Star EMR.  The nib on that is plastic and will need to be replaced.  Because the Supernote screen is more pliable than other devices, it's possible that nibs will last longer when used on that device versus other ones.

I purchased the A6X with the stock pen (ceramic nib) and it works great.  I also have a Lamy - but I use reMarkable nibs in it.  The stock Lamy nib on the Supernote felt too slippery.  The reMarkable nibs work great and have a better writing feel in my opinion.

I also have the Noris Digital Jumbo, and absolutely love the writing feel of that on the A6X.  I usually switch between the Noris and Lamy because I love both of them.

Based on a recent video from Voja ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgj5Y7NHY74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgj5Y7NHY74)) about the best pen and nib combinations for e ink devices, I have ordered the Samsung Tab S6 Lite pen and  HP ZBOOK X2 nibs.  Can't wait for those to come in.  On a side note, I also can't wait to order an A5X :D I had an Onyx Boox Max 3 and sent it back. Now I have a Supernote A6X. The A6X is far better than the Max 3 for the writing feel with the Lamy pen (with lamy standard nibs). The Supernote Pen is better than the Boox pen too.

"I use the Scribd app for ebooks and audiobooks. It is a service that is dying for an ereader but alas there isn't one. A partnership between Scribd and Supernote would be innovative! Copy that. Partnerships are both good and bad. How many devices do we  buy with preloaded applications we never wanted and can never get rid of? 

Is okay to offer it, but also allow the customer to delete it. The last thing Supernote needs is a application to Scribd that can never be removed by the customer.

Example, I dislike Facebook and never use it. But I can't uninstall it from my Samsung Note 9. I can turn it off, but it's always there. Very good points, I totally agree. I agree. I like the Kindle app on Supernote A6X - it works great on the e-ink screen and provides an option to read purchased books on an already excellent note taking device.

Having Scribd would provide a 'Netflix for books' like option to supplement Kindle's traditional book buying option and, for me, would complete the e-ink device experience.

I agree with another poster that too many apps would be cumbersome and detract from Supernote's streamlined user experience. If someone wants unlimited flexibility to download apps, Likebook and Onyx are options. I'm happy they picked Kindle and stuck with it instead of adding Kobo and Play Books and all the other alternatives. (I'd similarly be fine if they had picked a different store front - too many choices weigh down the user interface. Better to have one and stick with it.)

"Would it be possible to have a tools menu accessible in full screen mode? I like full screen for writing, but it is annoying to have to exit full screen to pull up the tool bar. Yes, a floating tool bar/bubble is comming in near update. Any chance of getting the A5 functionality of double tapping to go in and out of full screen? In the early design, we used a lot of hidden interactive functions. For example, double-click to enter/exit the full screen. Swipe from the side to the center of the screen to call the writing toolbar. Long press the file name to enter file delete/move/copy operations, etc. These designs make the interface more concise, but also cause some side effects. Most users will not read the user manual carefully (of course I do too), and they will complain if they don't know what to do. So in the later design, we try to avoid hiding functions, but it may be overkill.

" I know the Ratta team has a lot on their plates but hopefully this is something that can  be addressed in future software updates. I think both the rM and Supernote look as unclean as they do because of how note-taking on the devices themselves is the main selling point, and so to the creators of these eNote devices, export comes after that. Not saying that the exports should not look crisp, but it bears repeating what the primary intention of each device is to help understand where these young products stand. As for whether or not they're dealbreakers is up to the consumer.

In addition, Onyx Boox products tend to be somewhere in-between eNote and a full-blown eInk Android device, which is why they have the best of both worlds for software.

"After searching high and low, did you know, not a single note taking device or application offers hand recognition spelling checking. Not a single one.

If the device or application can do OCR for hand writing, then it could also spell check too. Normally OCR keeps some index of the words written to search against. That index could also be scanned against a dictionary. If the word is not found in the dictionary, the device or application could highlight or tag the word as misspelled. It's up to the developers of the tool offers spelling options or corrections.

I've put the same challenge to Goodnotes application team for the iPad. As I said, no one offers this feature yet. 

So depending if Supernote or Goodnotes implements first, then that's what I'm going with. My needs are simple, OCR for text search and spell checking. I posted before I finished. For OCR the possibilities really multiply. With standard text you can offer translation services.

Also, some people love writing notes, but they don't like their handwriting. So if you introduced OCR with font replacement, you can help those folks make beautiful notes. Write a word, and OCR picks up the word, and then replaces the word with nice font

Ratta might think of selling add-ons too. So everything I mentioned could be an additional extra folks could buy /unlock. No different that Goodnotes / Notability or other note taking apps.

If the difference between having full OCR with search and spelling check is extra $40, then that is worth it to me.

I hate subscriptions though. Have you checked out MyScript Nebo? I use it for long form writing (just straight up writing text, no drawings). It's on android and iOS and can convert your handwriting to text as you write. Just double-tap to convert. And it's easy to edit the text that's already been converted. Your handwriting style does not get saved. 

It can then export the text to different formats or other apps. I like to use it with Day One which is awesome for journaling. 

Doing long form writing on the Supernote feels like a lot of handwritten text that I have to review and type out if I want to make any good use of it. We have 3 goals

1 Make the note orgnized by original handwriting titles that can help user locate the page quickly. like ""table of contents"" of MS DocX.  Without any recognition. This is more free, you can set anything as titile, words, symbols,etc...

2 Can modify the DocX by handwriting. 

3 Can recogination entie page of handwring smartly(Able to distinguish between text and sketches) and output to Text/MarkDown/DocX.

"I was wondering if Supernote has any plans to support RemNote in X series (as RemNote is available as an android app) (see \[1\] below for further details on RemNote).

I think it would be quite useful to have an advanced note-management app (like RemNote, Obsidian, Roam research, Insight, etc) available in supernote directly; among these, RemNote is free and has an android app (btw I'm not affiliated with RemNote or anything, I just find it extremely efficient. See \[2\] for my use case).

I'm not sure whether this is a niche use case or whether there are a lot of supernote esers who would use this if it was available, so I'd appreciate if the community chimes in. Also, I'm tagging u/hex2asc : I'd appreciate if the Chief Chat Officer informs us to if there is any such plan :)  
\------

\[1\] For those who do not know, RemNote is a ""note-taking"" platform/app. It uses science-backed methods to ensure efficient learning (such as spaced-repetition, bi-directional linking, flashcards, etc).   Please see [https://www.remnote.io](https://www.remnote.io) for further details. There are several such platforms (RemNote in my opinion is most balakned, and is also free), for a nice comparison see these youtube videos [https://youtu.be/M2U61vHfQSQ](https://youtu.be/M2U61vHfQSQ) , [https://youtu.be/opSENgc45Sw](https://youtu.be/opSENgc45Sw) .

\[2\] I'm a PhD student in physics, and I use RemNote regularly to take both my academic notes and my daily scribbles . I  do not own a supernote right now, but I'll be buying a5x ---actually I would buy it right now while it is discounted but unfortunately I'm currently not in US and will not be back till the end of next month. I plan to use supernote to read papers (mostly arxiv stuff). I would definitely use this if it were available. I am not sure how feasible it would be though without the addition of an external keyboard. Part of the beauty of Remnote is how quickly one can enter and arrange data with keyboard shortcuts. But maybe I'm just too used to using it on my laptop to envision a new implementation.

Now, if only there were a way to have all of Remnote's features in a handwriting app then I would be in pure bliss. 🤗 I have to admin that I don't know RemNote or similar types of tools.  
My question here is how much RemNote needs web connection and ""intelligence"" from other places to organize/restructure information.

I think one of the main positive features of Supernote is that is focused on note taking, it can be used offline and you can choose when you need to go online or USB-connect to transfer/synchronise your stuff.  
To be too much dependent on external engines or tools (if this is something RemNOte requires) is not something I see as a positive path for Supernote, but of course this is a personal and quite limited point of view from myself :-) The poor CCO does not know much.

"Hi, I see with pleasure that Supernote is working hard to support editing functionalities for digital formats (i.e. Word .docx).

I have to admit that I'm not using them a lot now, but I'd like to ask here why the .docx format and if Supernote is planning to have a more general and standard approach to this.

Word is a proprietary tool and .docx is a not-so-great standard for text document (I don't use MSOffice and I use the standard .odt format, supported by LibreOffice, OpenOffice... for text documents).

What I'm thinking is whether simpler plain text formats could be supported as a more standard and interoperable basis to transform digital notes.  
I think that simple .txt files would be the first step, but an open and widely implemented and supported structured text format as Markdown ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)) would be an ideal solution.

I can see (dreaming) simple signs (short line or asterisks) for writing bullet points or identifying headers in the notes or ways to reference other notes (internal links). You already have some functions transforming manual input into structured commands (e.g. the square brackets or the stars for notes, the insert or flip command in the Word files) so it seems to me a natural evolution for more advanced functions.

I think that having a plain text format like Markdown supported could allow to have multiple types of export from it (.docx, .odt, .rst, simple .txt) and it can be well connected also with (future implementations of?) text recognition and transformation from manual notes to structured text.

Anyway, this is just food for thought... :-)

Ale I would personally love that feature! I do remember reading on this reddit that Mzrkdown support is planned. Text and MarkDown will be support. It’s in plan.

I find them both very comfortable to hold. The Lamy might be better for controlling the pen when trying to do precise work and it's lighter than the Heart of Metal. However, it probably comes down to personal preference. If you have access to a regular Lamy pen, the experience will be similar if you want to test it against a typical metal executive type pen that the Heart of Metal emulates.

The ceramic nib on the new Heart of Metal pens ensures that you won't have to worry about replacing nibs as they wear out. 

Personally, I like them both and alternate between them. The Lamy will also work on other EMR enabled screens like some Chromebooks and tablets. The ceramic nib on the Heart of Metal is hard so shouldn't be used with a device other than the supernote.

If you do a fair bit of drawing, then the Lamy might be the better pick. If you mostly take notes, I think that the Heart of Metal has the overall edge. I watched your guide and thought it was very good. I've watched many of your in-depth reviews and rely on them for choosing e-ink devices.

I would comment that I was surprised at the lower rating for Precision that you gave the Lamy (7/10) - not a bad rating - but in my experience, I found its precision to be very good and more comparable to the top of the group.

I was also surprised at the higher rating for the Samsung. It's a better pen than the standard Boox, but I didn't see it as anything special - too thin for my taste, round unlike the Staedler, and I didn't like the feel of the soft nib at all.

Otherwise, I agree with your ratings. 

Thanks for the guide! Thank you! You've been very helpful!",Difference between AL-star EMR and the other styluses,title prediction
"Hello all
I just figured out some of the basic yet powerful features needed on the the Supernote devices.

The pdf experience on the supernote is not bad, but some of  functionalities on it would make it great for any kind of document format...

1. Landscape mode for pdf documents.
2. Crop Features including the article mode support 
3. Gesture for bringing up the table of contents.
4. Insert clipart / image while taking notes.
5. Pinch to zoom in and out the content.

These features would make even the smaller A6x fully functional.

2. I will forward it to PM.
3. In kindle device, we can tap the top area to call the TOC. But in Supernote, we must filter the tap when writing. So can we call the TOC from sidebar?
4. In plan, but not start
5. Is developing. Awesome...
Thank you for the kind response
Really love the device and the writing feel on it
But yeah some times I feel adding functionalities would make the device even more better...

Looks like a lot of new features are on the map and really looking forward to see them on my A6X.

Reg.2 I mean TOC while reading pdf textbooks and not on the notes app.
And yeah if it is possible to call the TOC through the sidebar it would be handy and neat.
I have some ideas but not sure if it is possible to implement them on the device.
1. In a document -&gt; In the full screen mode (I mean *only when double tapped on a document to get rid of all the UI elements) - the sidebar when swiped up  instead of showing the regular app navigation menus it would be great if it shows TOC and as uasual manual refresh when swiped down. 
On exit (I mean again double tap) brings everything to the normal way as usual as it is at the moment...
(OR)
Atleast an option to manually set what the swipe up side bar does in which TOC is an option.

2. Two finger swipe on screen from left to right to bring up the TOC in a box covering half the screen is also an option...",Manditory Functionalities needed on the Supernote devices,title prediction
"I really like how responsive and supportive the Supernote team is, especially on Reddit. It's great to see they consider the user experience and feedback. A little while ago someone posted something and a rep from the team made a comment like 'we hadn't thought of that, it's an interesting idea'. I think this type of feedback system is great!

However, I feel a lot of people post on this sub with a kind of 'all or nothing' slant - like if 'Supernote doesn't do X, then I'm not buying!' It""s fine, it's a forum, it's up to you to make your line in the sand somewhere. But, why are some people writing so absolutely? I think if we have feedback or suggestions, it would probably be most effective written with examples or justification or use-case scenarios. I know I'd be more inclined to listen to well-explained ideas rather than ultimatums. 

Alas, just some boxing day venting. Cheers y'all You should see r/remarkabletablet if you think this is bad... Not comparable.
Remarkable support does not respond, it is normal that ppl go absolute in that case. Supernote read every single line and answers.
The point is not ""it is bad"", the point is ""it has no sense to write with this tone."", as far as I understand. Yeah, in general I agree. A lot of people are kinda taking the teams responsiveness for granted.

Here are just a few examples:  

* ""I've put the same challenge to Goodnotes application team..."" ""My needs are simple""
* ""Mandatory functionalities needed""
* ""Why are you not supporting""

As much as I love the teams responsiveness, I do feel some people have been quite harsh in their wording when making requests.

Personally I'd rather the team improve what they already have, before adding more work to their plate and bloating the system. I've always seen Supernote to be a minimalist alternative to other devices simply for ""note-taking"".

I guess some people want stuff with all the bells &amp; whistles like:

* E-reader with pdfs, news, books, and probably even websites.
* E-writer with every single text format.

Which is pretty much the Onyx Boox. Which is not minimalist or lightweight. I'd personally rather a tool that does one job, and one job well. To jump off of the last sentence:

As useful as the kindle update is, I'm very excited for the improvements they're making with their native writing software (e.g. pencil brush and Word editing). They're consistently refining the ""mobile office"" idea with each update, and I'm glad to see that they take the time to put in additional stuff but only as secondary or supportive of the ""mobile office"" theme. Hopefully in the next update or the one after it, they have some improvements for the native pdf reader for markup and export.

"I had my A6x for a few months now, but today was the first time I had to transfer some files to it from my phone.  I tried to pair it, but I keep getting nowhere.  I tried initiating pairing from the phone and A6x with same results.

Basically the two devices see each other, both pop up a pin screen and both have a pair button.  When I click pair button on A6x a keyboard pops up, which I assume is to enter the pin.  When I enter the pin it kicks me back out of the bluetooth settings screen. The two appear to be briefly connected, but then connection is lost.  Any clue what's going on.

If it matters I have a Google Pixel 4 that works fine with my other bluetooth devices. We think that the Bluetooth transmission rate is low, so we did not use it to transfer files. And only use it to support Bluetooth keyboards and Bluetooth speakers. It will failed to connect to other devices. But we should give tips for other connections that are not supported. Clear information should be given instead of letting users guess what happened. This is our mistake. We will fix it as soon as possible.

If you transfer files from a mobile phone, it is recommended to use cloud synchronization. You can use Supernote Cloud or Dropbox. You can also use Wifi-Direct to transmit directly (it needs to be on the same WIFI network, sometimes it is not stable). Both of these methods require you to install the Supernote Parter App or Dropbox App on your phone. Is there any update on the super note app not functioning for the last few months?

1) How long does it take to ship? I live in California.

2) Is there a desktop app? If so, can I create a note in the desktop app or is it simply importing/exporting? The reason I ask is because my work prevents me from using cloud services due to security reasons. I was hoping I could import screenshots from my work computer and place it in a note on the A6X via USB.

3) How frequent are you guys recharging your device?

TIA!! Hello.

1. About the ship... It took me 7 days aprox to come to Spain. But I paid €150 of taxes...
2. Nope. Only the Browser version of supernote's app. But you can configure dropbox. The only problem is you cannot see notes in dropbox. You must export first to PDF or JPG from your A6X.
3. It depends, it can last 1 week if you use it for hours. For me is about 2 - 3 weeks of light use because I'm not that busy right now.

Anytime! 1) West Coast here. Bought it on Christmas, got shipped on the 28th, and received it on the 31st. So 3 or 6 days, depending on how you measure it.

3) I charged it once in the time I've had it, though it's about to need another one. 2. I find even though I sync to Dropbox, I don’t review my notes on devices other than the Supernote itself.

"Hi! A very happy user of A6X here. I had a feature request. 

Currently the name of a new note is basically the timestamp without spaces. I do want dates as the name of the notes, but I would like the option to make it more readable so I don't have to change it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason and explanation:

* I find using the keyboard and renaming a notes doc every time I create one tedious, and the current timestamp one is not as readable
* Mostly I end up just adding spaces/dashes to make it more like yyyy-MM-dd-timstamp format, so would be great if say the device could give option what the default name is. 
   * Some options could be
      * yyyy-MM-dd &lt;day of week&gt; i.e. 2021-01-05 Tuesday
      * yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss i.e. 2021-01-05 12:00:00
      * yyyy MMM dd i.e. 2021 Jan 05
      * and many more
   * In case of duplicates, the notes can always append (count) to differentiate. Eg: ""2021-01-05 (1)"" if another file with the same name exists After seeing your suggestion, I immediately understood why I always thought the default file name was strange before.

"Hey... Just ordered A5X and have a few questions.

I have a sizeable Zotero library 6000+ pdfs that I currently sync to my BOOX via Google drive and an app (autosync). This works pretty well as Zotero automatically names the pdf files with author-year-title, and search is quick enough on BOOX to bring up the thing I need in a couple of seconds. I can then annotate and save, the annotated version gets automatically synced back to my laptop.

What I want to know is - does dropbox sync on Supernote automatically keep in sync? How well will Supernote handle that many PDFs in terms of search speed? And, will annotations be backed up straight to Dropbox/laptop?

Cheers! How are you using Zotero as a pdf library? :O Annotations are backed up to drop box as a separate .mark file. So you’ll have the original unedited .pdf, plus a .mark with annotations. 

You have to export or use the supernote companion app if you want new pdfs that have the annotations integrated. Zotero works really well to organise pdfs - you can drag/drop a pdf onto the main window and it will usually find the metadata for it (better than other reference managers I've used). The trick for getting pdfs easily available on mobile is to use the extension 'zotfile' which will rename the pdf and move it from Zotero's own labyrinth directory structure into one big directory that you can sync with Google Drive/Dropbox. Also, the browser addon for Zotero is great for taking html snapshots of webpages - these come out really well on Boox devices (I don't know about other ereaders) as text-resizable books.

The annoyance on Boox (as with Android tablets/phones) is there is no way to push changes to the Google drive folder to the device, so you have to use a third party app that you manually sync or set it to look at time intervals. This works, but just not very efficient.

There is an android app - zoo for zotero - that's really well made and can link to the synced folder to open pdf attachments. The problem is that when you have a lot of pdfs it can be very slow to open the pdf. Maybe down the line a version for Supernote could be great. Ah, thanks for the info. That should work fine for my needs. In some ways it is better to keep the version in my Zotero library clean from my scribbles anyway and it is good to have a separate place for marked up versions to know what's been read, maybe.","Zotero, Dropbox sync and search capabilities A5X",title prediction

an Idea I had, since kindle is its own aplication would be adding a small memo pad on the top pull down menu, that way taking quick notes from kindle (or any future apps might be possible) within the app. I dont know how feasible it is to make the app and note function work at the same time.

another thing I was thinking which I dont know if it is already a setting or not since I could not find it, is displaying the residence or contact info at the lock screen, in the case the tablet gets lost.

currently If I loose my device, whoever finds it would need to unlock it, go to the menu, find account information and then contact me.

"Hi Supernoters, I have a question.  

I am on the A5.  I have a note page that I use to document and track my billable hours for consulting services.  For ease of documentation of my consulting hours, I linked this page under [Quick access].  That note file now is now 37 pages long, and grows weekly.  Every time I go to [Quick access] and open this this note file, it opens by default to the first page.  I then have to jump to the last page to add new hours.  Is there a way to have Supernote to open (by default) the last page that was opened?  Has someone found a workaround?  If not, then can the last paged opened in a note page be the default when accessing a note file from [Quick access]?

Thanks Tats a neat idea. Could definitely see how that is useful. On drawboard there is a little symbol that lets you jump back to the start of the previous  'timestamp' like when you first started a chapter or something. It would be cool to have Great suggestion.

"Hello Supernote,

I’ve pre-ordered the 5x and am excited to start using it!  I’ve been watching videos on it and noticed you changed the ‘create’ button so that instead of instantly creating a new note, you now have to choose whether you want to add a note or a Word document. 

I think many of us will rarely (if ever) create a Word document as we have purchased this device primarily for making hand written notes. 

Can you please either move the Word document creation to another location, or only show that option after a long tap-and-hold, etc. so that a regular tap on the ‘plus’ icon will simply create a note?

I plan to create dozens of notes per day so this would make the experience much more pleasant. 

Thanks for considering. Agreed Your suggestion make sense. We will change it soon.

Thank you very much. Thanks very much! Agreed too!! I dont really need the word document creation function so readily. Perhaps place that option in the document folder? Thanks so much to the supernote team! I feel theyve been so innovative :)",Return to single-tap note creation,title prediction
"Hi everyone,

1.  I saw something posted here a while ago about choosing a server, but I can no longer find it.  I created my account on the Supernote A5x and enabled sync.  Upon logging into the cloud in my browser I accidentally clicked the China location, not realizing I couldnt switch afterwards.  Is there any way to switch server location after the fact?  Is there an option on the physical device I may not be seeing?

2.  I was testing things out, creating notes and playing around with the features.  I hit the sync button to upload what I have, went to the server website, and all I can see are the folders Ive created.  No notes show up at all, only the one screenshot I took.  Any information on this?

3.  Is there an export/save as pdf option yet?  I saw the post from a while back that it was coming but I havent seen any updates on it so far.

Thanks in advance for any help! Re. 1, paging /u/hex2asc.

For 2, have you actually selected the folders you want to sync? It doesn't default to syncing anything and might just be showing you a skeleton directory structure.

For 3, hit the 3 dots -&gt; Export -&gt; PDF, or do you mean proper vector export? For 2.  How do I select which folders to sync?  Long press, check them, then hit sync from the drop down?

3.  I figured that one out, just what I needed it to do.  Edited my original post.

Thank you for your help! So you need to go back into settings, go into sync, and click the right arrow to choose folders. You can choose a folder by checking it or enter the folder by tapping it (say you only want to sync a subdirectory -- as an example, I sync a directory called Personal but not Work).

If the folder chooser doesn't show up, it's a software glitch -- rebooting (in the settings too) will fix it. I see the arrow, and all of my folders are checked off",Questions about syncing and other things.,title prediction

"Hey, so I'm upgrading my trusty old kindle keyboard ereader and I really really like the look of the supernote devices. They just look much nicer than boox in my opinion. I love the aesthetic, the nicer pens, the nicer cases etc.

One of the huge reasons to upgrade my old kindle is to get a Glow light. At the moment I use a clip on light that is a faff. I know supernote devices currently don't have lights but will they in the future? Is it worth me waiting to see if they get one?

My second question is will super note support apps/apks so I can borrow books from my local library? Here in the UK most library's use BorrowBox which has an Android app. The second most popular library app is Libby. Will Supernote make these two apps available?

Thanks Very much doubt they'll ever have a light, it requires more space between the pen and the screen which makes writing feel funny. I think it's unlikely you'll see such niche apps supported but I don't know their full plans with regards to app support. It kinda seems like you're looking for a different device than what supernote is trying to be, the target is note taking as a top priority. Yeah fair enough, thanks for the feedback. I'm also an app developer and would love to make some eink friendly apps so I guess the boox or likebook devices are the ones for me. I just thought the supernote looked so much nicer! I saw an old comment of a user that suggested a folio with an integrated light. That would be a perfect solution in my opinion.
You have it if you want to, don't have it if you don't want. While waiting for mine to arrive I've been thinking about some of the things I'd like to see added (like Libby/Overdrive)... but I'm also thinking about how difficult the Ratta situation is.

"From what I have understood there is no charger shipped with the device.  
I wanted to ask the following  
a)Does the supernote support fast chargers  
b)What type of chargers does Ratta recommend for the supernote? I mean how many Amphere Here's a comment from hex2asc on A6X charge:
&gt; A6X support USBPD (the main fast charge standard). It's a negotiation protocol. When plugged, the charger will ask A6X, ""how much current you want?"", and A6X always answer,""1.5A is enough"". So the charger will start supply current limited by the agreement. You need not worry about too much current would damage the device. Typically A6X will get full charged in 2 hours by a 7.5W (or more powerful) PD charger.
&gt;
&gt; If you want to use a fast charger, please make sure it's PD type.
&gt; 
&gt; It's also ok if you use a computer USB port for charge, it will take more time than PD charger, at about 3-6 hours. Because of computer USB port usually limit the current supply at 0.5A-1A level.

"Hi,  


I have been deliberating between the Remarkable 2 and Supernote A6x for a while.

I was just about to order the A6x but I saw a lot of people having battery issues. The Remarkable lacks a lot of features against the A6x but the battery is way more superior, it seems.  This is disappointing since rm2 has a 3000 mAh battery vs A6x is smaller with a 2900 mAh battery.

  
However, there have been some latest software updates (one of the 12 days ago) on the A6x and the release notes contains some changes to battery performance. What is the exact status about battery issues right now? If battery is a big deal for me, should I go for rm2 instead? I own both . I cannot recommend the rm2 honestly . Get the a6x or the a5x , stylus is better , more accurate ( never have misalignment issues like I do on the rm2)( no expensive nib replacements ) . Supernote developers are doing fixes and implementing useful and important  features ( have already experienced a few myself ) , where as all the updates on rm2 have been trivial and haven’t really added to the ( already barebones) utility.  I use my a6x many times throughout the day I maybe charge it ever 2 days . The great thing is I charge it with a USB c charger and it charges very quickly , battery is of no concern here coming from someone who’s used it for more than a month now .  The biggest pain point with the rm2 is that you cannot simply plug it in and quickly drag and drop files . You have to use their apps and cloud and other silly workarounds . With the supernote it is just drag and drop , updates instantly . They have also mentioned fixes to help battery further . I recommend supernote Rm2 is also more expensive.

Charging once in two days is not so bad. But do you employ it for heavy use, like taking notes the entire day or something? Sometimes when I’m doing long drawing or long notes i charge every other day . When I’m just using it as a planner many days can go by . So, the weird battery bugs are probably fixed by now, but it still probably stands at somewhere like 6 hours of non-stop writing (from [MyDeepGuide](https://youtu.be/mB8fTVPH1cY?t=948)).

I personally think Supernote is superior simply because you don't need to pay multiple times for a new nib. Though Remarkable 2 and A6X are kind of a bad comparison since, A6X is much smaller. I've had the impression that both A5X and it's upcoming successor (intended to be released Q3 this year), will and are clearly much better than rM2.

Also from what I've heard, rM2 has terrible customer service.

Good question! I also have a rM2--ideally would be great to be able to continue a journal I started on rM2 over to SuperNote. Seems unlikely tho :( I did it by using PDF export.

"Just want to shout out that I got my first e-ink tablet - Supernote A5x! 

I've been thinking about getting one for more than a year, following the development of Sony and Remarkable, and after watching the review by Voja, decided to take a leap and got it.

Quite happy with the device so far, and am excited to find this community and that Supernote is actually seeking users' opinion here!

Happy writing! Agreed! Awesome device paired with amazing customer service and community! I just joined “the family” too, I love that everyone on here (including Ratta Supernote themselves) is so helpful! :) Me too - got mine yesterday and stayed up till 1am figuring out how to customise it and get my stuff on it. Love that Supernote is very active in interacting with the users! And it seems like they will have frequent upgrades.

"I got my A5X yesterday in the post and so far I am loving it!
I am having trouble syncing my Dropbox to the device though. I have connected to my account successfully, and Dropbox has registered that the supernote is connected. 
However when I go to select the folders I want to sync, it does not show my Dropbox folders, only the folders that are already on my device. I've tried rebooting/resetting like a previous post suggested but no luck. Am I missing a step somewhere?
Thanks in advance! I was playing with this last night, and discovered it would only sync folders that were put in the Supernote main folders. It looks like you can’t add folders to those main ones (which are documents, notes, mystyle etc.) To get the main supernote folders to sync you have to select them so they have a tick in the top left hand corner - then they appear in Dropbox) you can then move files into them.

"Morning Coach just posted a quick snapshot of 6 ways the Supernote A5X beats the reMarkable 2:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL3wJnqN2P0&amp;feature=youtu.be

I sent back the RM2 because it looked good but didn’t offer much functionality. Then I returned the Note Air had the opposite problem – bloated with apps and a complicated user interface that made work harder. 

Supernote A5X seems to solve both problems with refined apps built for purpose and a simple, streamlined interface to get things done without any headaches. I’d rather be working on a task than working out how to use the device. This video should be shown to everyone that loves remarkable 2 over other devices lol. Other than sketching, supernote can do everything remarkable can do, and BETTER Well... wait for his ""6 reasons to get Remarkable 2 over A5X"" video in a few days ;) Altho, as an owner of both, I am currently won over by the A5X (even tho I still really enjoy the ""feel"" of the rM2 device and writing when I pick it up and use it). The functionality of the A5X has won me over (love keywords), and not having to replace nibs! Since you have both devices, can you describe the writing experience of Supernote versus reMarkable? A lot of users have trouble describing writing on a Supernote. 

Also, which stylus do you have - the ceramic or the Lamy (I still have my Lamy which I loved using). Remarkable 2 has a ""scratchier"" free. Not in a bad way--in a good way. I guess the best analogy I've heard is: it feels like using a pencil on paper laying on a table or clipboard. It's feels like a harder surface, but again--not in a bad way. Frankly, I still feel like I might prefer it to the A5X feel--even tho the A5X feel is also very good. Yep, I know, maybe not the most helpful.

The A5X has a smoother/slicker feel... and it also depends upon which A5X pen you use. I have both the Heart of Metal and Lamy. The Lamy has a slight scratchier feel, because it's plastic. The HOM is very smooth (ceramic). In reality, the A5X and Remarkable are probably very similar in smoothness--but the Remarkable seems to have more friction/scratchiness due to the sound of its tip on its surface.

FWIW--even though I may enjoy the feel of the remarkable more, i like the sharpness of the A5X pens more. I feel like I can write cleaner/thinner lines on the A5X due to the different pen/surface (especially with the HOM).

As far as which A5X pen I prefer--I still don't know. When I switch to the Lamy, I think ""oohhhh yeah--I think this feels better"". But then I'll use that for awhile, and then switch back to the HOM, and think ""yep, I like the sharpness with this"". So, I guess--get them both if you can(!) I DO love the eraser button on the Lamy--extremely useful. And while I wish the design was a bit better (so I didnt have to find  and line up my finger with the erase button everytime I grab the Lamy), I still think the Lamy is great especially if you think you'll be erasing more than usual. The way I look at it--the Lamy is an eraser I bought that also has a built-in pen ;) And the HOM is for when I just want sharp lines and I'm not worried about making mistakes and/or needing to use the eraser much. The UI's erase function still works well with either one, so not a big deal--but the Lamy's eraser button is very convenient once you have it and get used to it.",Morning Coach lists 6 reasons why Supernote A5X beats reMarkable 2,title prediction
"Dull - but necessary question.  I'd like to use my supernote for both personal purposes and work and therefore do have some questions about how my data is used. There are quite a few users in here from Europe (where GDPR or UK GDPR is applicable).  I had a look at your privacy policy and note that it says that it's only applicable for mainland China.  There is also a statement which says, ""In principle, the personal information we collect and generate in China will be stored in China"" [https://supernote.com.cn/user/PrivacyPolicyEn.html](https://supernote.com.cn/user/PrivacyPolicyEn.html) However you will be processing data which is generated elsewhere and stored in your servers either in China or Amazon Japan.   Please can someone provide more transparency about what happens with our data.  It's worth looking at RM's privacy policy as it does at least contain more specific info about what happens to our data. I usually don t care about this stuff, my data being anyway sold in every part of the globe, but tag me when someone replies, because now I am curious as well. Well... if you're using this as a digital notebook, you're likely storing more than just basic identity info such as email or phone number (the typical data sold around the world). People may choose to store very sensitive information in their notes... if the data is not protected, that data could be exposed. Which is why I'm very leery of putting any sensitive data in my A5X until I have the ability to store in a different service such as Google Drive. Even then, I'm still not fully trusting enough to put sensitive data in this device :( Thank you for bringing this up - it's something very reasonable to ask. I have the same problem as you because I want to use these devices for work and some of the things I write or draw could eventually become IP. If the data gets in the wrong hands, it's pretty well known some Chinese companies can steal and not care about IP ownership laws.
I'm really encouraged by Ratta's responses on this subreddit so would be great to hear from them on this. This is very important!

There are two types of data that will transfer to the server

The first is cloud services

In order to comply with Chinese laws (all companies providing information services in China must set up servers in China. Apple is no exception). But this doen't matter with users outside of China. What we said,  ""In principle, the personal information we collect and generate in China will be stored in China"" is mainly for chinese users. Don't worry about that.

If you want to use Supernote cloud service, we strongly recommend  do not use a Chinese server. (Amazon Japanese server is now available, US server/EU server is coming soon). Otherwise, you can use Dropbox instead. I don’t need to confirm if you are not a Chinese user, because Chinese users cannot see this message (Reddit is blocked in China).

Anyway. The most thorough method, you can turn off the cloud service. Use USB data cable, U disk and other methods to transfer data with computer.

The second is the User Experience Project.

If you agree to participate in the User Experience Project, we will upload some logs. It is usually the performance info in some operation events, such as the time it takes to open the file, the data of battery consumption, and the related information when the fault occurs. We use these data to evaluate and improve performance. It will not be used for purposes not related to improving performance. We will list log types and uses in detail later and update on the website. You are right, We need transparency.

If we need more detailed information for special purposes, such as improving the rendering of handwriting. We will launch a special volunteer program, where participants can send samples of their non-privacy note files to our collection mailbox. We will not store such data in the log.

Anyway, you can refuse to participate in the User Experience Project to avoid uploading any information.

I want to say that your concerns are absolutely necessary.

I.e. when exporting a note as a pdf, it would be great if I could have supernote insert a margin around the note. 

This would be useful if one wished make notes on the exported note using something like Skim on the computer. It would also be useful if the notes are to be submitted to a marker, as the marker would have more space to write comments.

"Just wondering about a possible implementation of a way to rapidly switch between two apps - like ALT-TAB on a computer. At the moment if I want to switch between a note and a book I have to swipe the side bar, then tap on the thing I want. This is pretty good. 

But I just wonder if there could be an option in settings to remap an up-swipe from screen refresh to app-switch. This would make an make it a really quick way to move between two things. 

If this option was selected, the screen refresh function could be activated by an on-screen button in the toolbar. Similarly, if the user chose to keep swipe up to refresh, then the toolbar button could active the app switch.

Just a thought! Interested to hear what others think. I do also really like swipe up to refresh, but for me personally I think I would get more use from switching apps.

Also, the ability to wake the device with a swipe (up or down) would be a nice touch - I find myself trying to do this anyway! :) I think clicking the button to wake to sleep is enough for me, even on my Boox it’s the same thing.

As for the swipe up to switch apps, I like it how it is now (swipe up to refresh), I actually have the same gesture on my Boox. Given that the limited number of apps is visible on swipe down anyway, I find that enough to switch between apps/documents really quickly. I would like this as an option, too. Perhaps it could be an option for the swipe up, to change in settings? Much like the first iPad allowed the switch to be either screen lock or something else (was it mute?), depending on user preference. I hardly use the swipe up. I think it would be awesome to customize and have users choose what they want that action to be. Personally I would like it to open the last most recent note or file so I can quickly switch between two. This would be a neat addition.",Swipe up for rapid app switching (and wake from sleep),title prediction

"I have 6 custom templates... they appear in the device's MyStyle folder, but only 4 of the 6 appear in the Template-&gt;Customization selection screen. Also, there are 2 templates I initially added but then deleted. Everything looks fine on the SuperNote (Japanese) cloud server/website, as well. It's just the the template-&gt;Customization screen that is messed up (only shows some of the custom PNGs I added, and 2 that I deleted are still there).

Yes, I have rebooted--a couple times, and I have sync'd a few times. I also made sure the MyStyle folder was checkmarked in the sync settings.

So... help... More details... I've played with the filenames of the png/template files I uploaded. I made them shorter and removed periods from them. I now get 4 of the 6 templates in my Customization template pages, and the deleted ones are gone. So now, I'm missing 2 of the 6. Is there a reason it will only show the first row of 4 in there? A common issue is the use of special characters in filenames as you have already discovered by removing periods from your filenames. Although the Supernote manuals list various characters to avoid they fail to include underscores in their list ( \_ ) which is often the culprit for custom templates not showing up. No underscores. The files that appear in the Customization page have the same format as those not appearing. Only use letters, numbers and spaces in the fielnames.

"Hey guys, just discovered e-ink devices recently and been doing some research. Even though i love the idea behind it, and am very intrigued to get one, I'm still between the fences about whether i really need one. 

Therefore, I'd like to find out what you guys are really using it for and what made you buy one. After all they aren't cheap devices and i wanna make sure I'm not wasting money. I use it as a daily planner , brain dump, sketch book , notebook all in one place. Helps me to organise my thoughts and notes beyond what I could with a regular notebook. Plus I just much prefer handwriting then typing on computer in meetings etc, I can concentrate better and also be more free in structure which helps me. Finally, the A5X is just so nice to write on that I now actually write more and I’m less precious about pages too! I should add that I also love that it’s not a tablet per say, so less distractions, blue light and need to recharge often. Not to mention no glass! I also own iPad Pro with pencil, and i love using the ipad with pencil mainly for marking up pdfs and notes. I also use it for board games (i'm a big boardgamer), in which I'll track game status/characters/etc by using PDF game sheets in Notability (ipad note taking app), and marking 'em up. BUT... I got intrigued by e-ink note takers for the better non-glass feel and to get away from staring into a computer/lit display. With that said... I'm fairly new with a rM2 and A5X. The software is generations behind iPad... but the e-ink/non-glass experience makes it worth if. Will I be solely e-ink and no iPad for note taking? Not sure. But right now, ive been 100% A5X (after starting with rM2) for about 4 weeks. Also using it for tracking workouts (I maintain a daily workout journal), general daily notes... and the keyword feature on the A5X has won me over, as it allows my to label/tag journal spots for easy searching. Software is quirky/buggy (e.g. the cloud sync functionality), but I'm hopeful (based upon Ratta's strong customer involvement/dialog) these will be ironed out and improved. Before I ve bought the A6X, I wanted to write, but the thought that pages end filled me with dread, so I didn t write. It s a poor excuse, because I do not write even after I acquired an infinite amounf of digital pages.

If I had the money, I would have definitely gone with the iPad Pro, but I am glad I didn t. 

An e-ink tablet is the perfect substitute for a notepad and that s all it is to it.

What sold it to me was the infinite pen and the community that they ve build on reddit, the last being the most important. Now, thinking about it, whatever they would sell, I would buy.

Hi u/Hex2asc,

I’ve had my A5X a few days and I think it’s fantastic. Here is some initial feedback, requests and questions:

&amp;#x200B;

**Feature requests**

* Please can we have caps lock on the keyboard
* Please can we have a way to add accents to letters in the keyboard
* There should be the ability to change the date format (eg dd/mm/yy) from the default American format of month-day
* Should be able to send PNG attachments in email. Currently, sending attachments only works with PDF, while PNG attachments are ignored
* Please can we have indented lists in Word when using bullets?

**Questions**

* In word, is there some way to erase a handwritten mark or writing?   
If I make a mistake while adding handwritten text or marking up, there seems to be no way to delete it, other than double-tapping to convert it and then deleting it after conversion, which is really laborious. It would be great to have an eraser button.

**Other feedback/bugs**

* When switching from handwriting to typing in Word or when turning on repage view, any hand writing on the page is deleted without any warning or asking to convert it first. This is a serious issue and can cause a lot of lost work.
* Backspace connect does not work as described in the manual 
* You can't rename a Word doc when it’s open the way you can with a note. This feels inconsistent
* When renaming a doc or note from the files overview, the 'x' is too far to the right (this does not affect the function, it’s just is an aesthetic UI bug)
* Deleting a document in the cloud from the browser interface does not work. You get a confirmation, but the file stays in the folder, even after sync. The only way to delete it is from the A5X device itself, which then works across the device and the cloud after syncing.

Thank you in advance for your consideration and keep up the great work! Just a quick feedback on ""Please can we have caps lock on the keyboard"".

I can simply double click the ""Shift"" (big up arrow) key. I agree for the date, it is really confusing, it should adjust based on the timezone or let us define the way we want to appear ""Deleting a document in the cloud from the browser interface does not  work.

Awesome! Somehow none of the  reviews I have watched mention the hyperlink support. And I had a very very negative experience with the Remarkable's software making me cautious purchasing cool looking but expensive products.

Is the table of contents collapsible and respecting the hierarchy? I.e. is it easy to navigate a book with four chapters but hundreds of paragraphs in the TOC? Or everything is on the same level (making it difficult to find the chapters)? If the latter, is it on the timeline to fix it?

And is there an option to search for PDF metadata? I plan to have many pdfs on the device and I would like to search for authors/title/arxiv number (if the title is long, then it's not practical to use it as a file name) etc. This fantastic mate.

"All of the other e-ink devices are available on either Android or Linux platforms. Supernote is the only device that gives you a choice because its tablets are available with either operating system. Amazing.

I’d like to know what users see as the pros and the cons of both platforms. Do Supernote’s Linux products have a faster processing speed or better latency? Do the Android devices offer better functionality? 

Why do you think one is better than the other, based on your use case? I’d love to know what Ratta thinks as well and why they are committed to producing two versions of the A6 and A5. I went with the A5X because although I don't use Kindle it seems like the Android OS has more potential for additional functionality in future. It's been working great so far - it does slow down a lot when I'm drawing and using the copy/paste and resizing features heavily but honestly I don't really mind that as drawing really isn't the primary reason I got it. I also can't comment on whether the A5 is any better in this respect - maybe someone else could add something here?

I saw it said somewhere that although the battery capacity is greater on the A5X the android OS is more demanding and so the battery life is actually lower - again I don't have a point of comparison but I certainly haven't had any issues with battery life, keeps going for multiple days.

"I preordered the A6X and I've really enjoyed it as my first ereader and note taking device. However, there are basic navigation features that would make it much easier to use.

It's annoying to flip through tens of pages when navigating through documents and digests. There should be an an option to skip multiple pages, skip to the end, and enter a page number (similar to when navigating documents). Even better would be searching for files or folders in the current directory or skipping by alphabetic ordering (skip to where Hs or Vs begin like a contact book).

It would be nice to have a back button when navigating documents. So when I open a folder, I can go back to the same page in the document navigator rather than flipping through all the pages to get back to the same page.

Most if not all good epub readers automatically embed links to footnotes, so you don't need to flip to the references pages to find the footnote. It'd be really nice if I could tap on a footnote and have the footnote appear in a little window.

One should be able to annotate digests in the document viewer, rather than navigating to the digests app.

Each of these features would improve the ease of use a lot for me. In addition, having a overview that shows a grid of all pages like the remarkable would make it much easier to navigate visually when you don’t already know which page number you want You are in luck!! All of these options are available on your device already! Taping the ellipse in the toolbar brings up the menu which the overview option which brings up page thumbnails. u/official_marcoms. Taping on the page numbers opens up the ability to jump to any page you would like. Dragging down from the top of the screen allows you to search all directories by file name, keywords or stared pages. I highly recommend running through the user manual there are a lot of hidden tools and gestures built into different parts of the device and Ratta is always listening to its users for more feedback! I think I wasn't clear on the page skipping. I don't mean the pages in a document, I mean the pages when browsing through files and folders. It would be great if the same functionality to skip to a page in a document also worked when browsing a folder of documents. I sometimes reverse the sorting so I can at least flip through each page in the list of documents from the reverse of the alphabetic order.

I like the search function, this is ends up being the best way to go. Searching in the current directory is what I usually want, but this isn't so important.

I realized the last feature is in the user manual. I was tapping digests with the stylus, but I figured out that I need to tap it with my finger to annotate a digest.",Feature Request: Navigation and Usability,title prediction

"Random notes from today's waste management class on Vermicomposting. I really like taking notes by hand I find that I remember more of the content when I draw and doolie the ideas out. This is one of the many reasons I really enjoy my supernote. It has become part of my study pattern to go back, edit and clean up the doolies a bit. After class, I will take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour adding to the notes and doodles. The post by u/teicherus of the [possible colors values](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/lmo94r/possible_color_values_for_templates/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) on the SN have me excited about the potential of the current hard wear and to see what other tools are to come! 

Additionally, I enjoyed the use of the floating toolbar, however, I wish I could turn it horizontal again.  I used to keep it docked to left hands side of notes and it was rarely in my way (right-handed). I very much like the ability to collapse it and move it freely but if I could have the choice, either in the settings or on the toolbar, to select horizontal or vertical position when free that would be awesome. Seems like it might be an easy addition?

One other thing I really love is the title page, its use for building a table of contents is perfect functionality! However, I don't like the hash marks. I would like to still be able to differentiate the title without effectively crossing them out.  Is there currently a way to disable that or a workaround anyone has found? For future updates, I personally would rather brackets around the title much like the diegest. Or even a box but the hash marks kinda kill it for me.

The only thing I miss about taking notes on paper is that I used a lot of color-coding and go back through and watercolor them. One day a super note with a color E-ink screen,... now that would be pretty sweet..

I'm trying to figure out how to get a pen that is heavier overall because I'm finding I don't press hard enough to get that feeling of resistance anymore.

You covered all of the features and attributes of the three pens extensively, including the writing experiences. Just what I needed to know. These styluses are another reason to love Supernote.

Just one thing I’m curious about — spoiler alert — I assume the HOM pen is also your favourite for drawing, but what about marking up documents where you’d use a stylus to highlight text rather than write? ... Would Lamy’s “gliding over the paper” be better here than HOM’s “digging into the paper” sensation?

Whatever the case, it’s good to see one manufacturer offering high quality pens (plural) that deliver different benefits to different users. I don't own the basic pen, only the Lamy and the HOM, but I agree with you even if my opinion isn't perhaps as strong!

Now I own the Max Lumi, too, but my go-to is still the Supernote for the calendar, general note-making and the reading smaller page-sized PDFs. I just love the feel of the screen with the HOM! The digest annotation feauture, the sharpness of the screen rendering, the ability to star your faviourites, the way you can organise a notebook, the support team, etc., make this one of the best purchases I have made in a long time, and your videos were key to that, so thanks!

"I've been on and off the last few months waiting to get the RM2, until I discovered SuperNote, and I have a few questions.

1) The A5x and A6x are basically the same exact thing, except for the size of the device? I read elsewhere on the reddit that palm-rejection is missing on the smaller one too, but it's on the road map?

&amp;#x200B;

2) As someone who will use the device for taking various notes, how much of a deal breaker is the size of the A6x vs the A5x in your opinion? I may do some lite kindle reading, but I highly doubt it.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Any general reviews, tips, tricks, etc are welcome. I haven't seen much on here, but I've spent time watching videos from CPO, MyDeepGuide, GoodeReader, and a few other channels. 1. They run the exact same firmware, so functionally yes. The screen of the smaller one/A6X is glass and the larger one/A5X is... not-glass (plastic?)... but same film on the screen. The smaller one has higher ppi. The A6X actually does have palm rejection (I use it!) I think I’ve read here the A5X that doesn’t have it yet but I’m not sure. 

2. For note taking, I would base it on your preferred size of paper notebook. I literally tried measuring it out before I bought one to get a feel for the size haha. A6X screen is basically the size of an iPad mini screen. I think it’s a great size because it’s about the size of the notebooks it replaced for me (Moleskine Large)  but it’s really dependent on what you are comfortable with. 

3. [I did a short sort-of-review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/l7rgn5/a6x_initial_reviewfirst_impressions_latency_etc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) when I got my A6X, with some photo comparisons etc. which might help you decide! I'll make sure to check out the review (I started to earlier, but got sidetracked watching some videos on the devices).

&amp;#x200B;

To try and put size into perspective, if it's a standard college-ruled notebook (or maybe a 1-inch binder) how do the devices compare? 2. Keep in mind that the A6 writing area is small. 4 and 5/8 inch by 6 and 1/8 inch. The external size of the A6X is about the size of an A5 notebook. So if you are used a Moleskine or Leuchtturm1917, you'll want to go with the A5X even though the external size of the A5X is bigger than those notebooks. 

3. If you write small like me, you may go with the 0.2 nib size. But on the A5X, the lines look a bit jagged. Ratta is working on this issue. On the A6X, the higher resolution means I find it more comfortable to write in my usual handwriting size without the cognitive dissonance of the jagged lines. But I like having the physical screen real estate of the A5X. One thing that helped me with the nib size issue is to use a finer point stylus. Those are definitely closer to A5X.

The photos in the post I linked show the A6X, open, next to Rhodia and Moleskine notebooks and a Kindle Paperwhite for reference. I don’t share the experience of the poster below at finding it small (you’ll see in the photo the screen width is about the same as a page on a Moleskine), but you sound like you’re used to much larger paper notebooks so I would skew larger!",Opinions,title prediction
"I have a 6X. When I set it down on a metal cart near my work station it goes to sleep so I could not see my notes. I was getting frustrated thinking maybe that was an intended function to save battery or something. Just realized it only happens on the metal cart. When I set it down on another surface it stay on. Maybe an interaction with the magnet that is used to trigger sleep/wake? Hi u/betterwithchem, I have the same issue on a metal Ikea balcony table. The whole A5X actually feels to stick to the table slightly when the cover flap is folded underneath. Try leaving the cover open like a normal book, instead of folding over and underneath the device. I have better results like that usually... That is definetly the sleep function the supernote has for its folio. When ever the folio closes the supernote will go to sleep and when opened it will wake up the supernote. This is done with magnets. Since the table is metal the supernote's think it's the folio in its closed position and it goes to sleep, try placing something like a book or a cardboard between the supernote and the surface to avoid that problem. Maybe even consider using a stand. /u/hex2asc Is there a way we can get a switch in the settings to disable close-to-sleep?

"I use my A5X to take notes primarily, but thinking of trying the RM2 because I have been less than impressed with battery life? Any thoughts? I have the A6X and RM2 and honestly prefer the A6X.  The RM2 seems bulky even though it isn't really.  I like how the a6x feels to write on (though I hate the new movable menu.  HATE), and the RM2 does not feel like paper.  The menus seem more difficult to navigate, though I probably just need more practice.  If yoyve already got the a5x id just stick with that. &gt;already got the a5x id just stick with that.

My thought as well. Battery life on the rM2 is great when the device is idling (not in use) when in use it's not that great, but more than enough. You might get better battery life with the rM2 (don't have both, can't compare) but the difference won't be that big, and the rM2 is more fragile (glass based screen, some people have problem with the little button because it's in a zone that easy to shock, etc.). If you have a SN and it suits your need, no need to bother with the rM2 IMO, unless battery life when idling is your main criteria. Yes, I have both, and I have to say, it's a really tough call between them, but at the moment, I'm leaning more to the A5X.

Points in the RM2's favor:
* Significantly longer battery life
* Best writing feel (in my opinion)
* Calligraphy pen (I love it!)
* Thumbnails show writing on PDFs (this is important to me because I edit a lot of PDFs and it's easier to keep track of what document I've worked on)

Points in the A5X's favor:
* Ceramic nib, no more replacing plastic nibs
* Continued platform development (calligraphy pen coming soon, along with many other developments)
* Wakes up when folio is opened

The ceramic nib is what tips my preference for the A5X: I hate the idea of having to replace nibs every two weeks to a month (depending on how much writing I'm doing) and gives me the mental freedom to write and write without thinking about how I'm wearing down the nib, or ordering new ones, and so on. The fact that Ratta is so responsive to users also stands in stark contrast with Remarkable's radio silence. I know that the Supernote platform will continue to improve, so I'm willing to wait for things like a calligraphy pen. (And they are also working on battery life -- it's never going to reach the same level as RM2's, but I wouldn't be surprised if they managed to get another day out of the existing design.)

If what you're looking for is for someone to assuage your concerns that you may have made a wrong decision, here it is: stick with the A5X, the Remarkable is not significantly better to justify forking over a ton of money for similar functionality. Yes, the battery life is better, and I love the feel, but unless the A5X's battery life is causing you major headaches, stick with what you've got.",Does anyone have Remarkable 2 and Supernote A5X?,title prediction

"I recently returned a reMarkable 2 and replaced it with the A5x. Overall I'm happy with the switch, but there are two features I REALLY miss:

1. The send to reMarkable Chrome plugin which allowed me to send pretty much any article I found online to my reMarkable as a PDF. Amazing! Any chance Ratta could offer something like that?
2. The ability to simply flip the stylus around and use the other end as an eraser. It is so much easier and more natural. And yes, I have the Lamy pen but don't use it at all because my finger often accidentally pushes the erase button. If you print from you desktop and save to your Dropbox folder (if you sync that way) it is just as quick in my experience. 

But I also am on a Mac and don’t like chrome. So I am not the most objective. 

On my iPhone I use the Instaweb browser and it prints to an a5 pdf format which i save to my Dropbox folder and it is quicker and more reliable than the remarkable app in my experience. 

I am supportive of the idea of a chrome plugin. But I think the syncing options on supernote make it unneeded Thank you for your feedbacks. I think something will be change. I haven't found the dropbox synching to be that easy to set up. And it's hard to imagine anything easier than being on a site like The Atlantic, going to the top right of the browser and clicking the button that says ""send to reMarkable"" and having it instantly appear on your tablet.

"Wondering if anyone else lately is noticing issues with the screen? I've had my A6X for about 6 - 8 months, but the last probably month or so am noticing some issues (Tried looking for similar problems but didn't see any, if I've missed this issue posted somewhere else please let me know!)

*Processing video 0vi6y64bq9q61...*

1. Not recognising touch. I've attached a video from this morning. It's not all the time, but happening probably every 2nd day now, it randomly won't recognise touch input - only pen; or vice versa. Restarting does work, but I often have to restart 2 or 3 times for it to work, and sometimes it won't restart (it just sits there refusing to accept either input). 
2. The bottom half of the screen seems to be not always responding properly to pen input. Having trouble filming this, as I notice it mostly during lectures when I'm writing a LOT in a short amount of time, and am willing to accept that it could well be me writing in a hurry and causing the issue. Occasionally when I write, the words/strokes are half missing, like a pen running out of ink. And on the right-hand size, about 1/3rd of the way down, there's a weird ""blip"" section where if I draw a straight line, it instead sometimes curves outwards (again, hard to film, it doesn't seem to do it when I want to hahaha) or if I write on lined templates near there it won't write in that spot, instead bunching the letters up behind it as if I were trying to write off the edge.

I haven't dropped, damaged, banged, spilled anything on, sat near or on a magnetic device, or in any other way I can think of caused any damages to the device, I study from home and it lives on my desk 95% of the time. Any thoughts? I'll try to get a video of the ""low ink"" issue asap. Hopefully this is just a simple thing fixed in the next update :) I have similar issues but mine do not seem as prevalent as yours. At times my A5X will not recognize a finger touch until I use the stylus first. But after I use the stylus once it usually goes back to normal. Yeah, it used to do that rarely, but this has become much more pronounced, and the only fix I can find so far is a restart (or three hahaha). It's not happening often enough to really be a huge problem or anything, but the increase has me a bit worried. And the words not writing properly at the bottom are a bit concerning too, but I'm still not sure if that's just how I'm writing, or a genuine issue. Hey mate, are you still experiencing this issue or did Rata sort it out yet? I've been looking to get one of these devices but have seen this complaint pop up a couple times and am just wondering if its an ongoing thing. I was, and ended up emailing about it, and they replaced the device. I am having some possible issues with the new one, but not sure yet if that's just me (different problem). Regardless, I absolutely love mine, even if there are a few bugs or problems. I think pretty much every company will have issues like this, but the stand-out thing for me is their customer service and support. Even with the issues, they've been fantastic at talking it out and trying to sort out the issues; plus they listen to us as customers when we suggest changes or things we'd like to see.",Screen Issues,title prediction
"I have a couple of custom Note templates I use for meetings. One has a Title/Attendee/Follow Up area at the top that I use as the first page of notes for any meeting, and then when I continue taking notes on the next page, I change to the 8mm rule stock template. Then the next time I have a new meeting for the same client or project, I switch back to my custom template for that first new meeting note page.  


So, my request(s):

&amp;#x200B;

* Can we have an option to sort templates with custom ones first when we go to template selection? That would put my three custom ones first, and then the 8mm ruled one would be immediately following, and I would not need to go to the next page of templates every single time a new meeting comes up.
* In the alternative, give us the ability to rename templates so we can then sort them in any order by name.
* This third is a long shot. Can we specify how many pages a template will be used when selected, and then the one to follow it? So, I can have my custom template selected, and when I go to the next page, it will automatically shift to the ruled template I select as the second page of any meeting. Then I'll only need to select my own template for the first page of a meeting, and not need to select any other. This should override the system default for the Note template.

Thanks! I was thinking last night how much easier it'd be to be able to sort the templates, just hold to rearrange so the most-used are first in the list or something. Most used or last used would work very well for my use case. I just hate to go to the second page of templates for no good reason almost every time I have a meeting. Agreed, I use mine mainly for study and have made up some templates for definitions or equations and some summary sheets for lectures or chapter notes, and having to keep scrolling through them all to set those up for each lecture is not quite ""annoying"" as such, but it would be simplified with the option to arrange how I'd like. It's not a hugely inconvenient thing, but I was uploading more last night and starting to realise just how many I have now, and thinking that it's going to become a bit harder to find what I want (I am a self-confessed digital-hoarder and can absolutely guarantee I'll end up with way more templates than I need or use regularly hahaha) Most used or let the user rearrange the order to their own accord.",Feature Request - Template Sort Order,title prediction

"First, I’d like to thank this forum, as it has been key for my decision to buy this fantastic device. I reserved a Remarkable last summer and changed my mind after being surprised on how responsive the Supernote community was.

I’ve used the A5X for more than 2 months now and I absolutely love it. I’m not the artist-type of user and my goal was to use it as a replacement of my work paper-based notebooks. I have to say the A5X nails it for this purpose.

However, there’s always gap for improvement and I’d like to request some improvements that will make my life easier.

1) Move pages to other notes. Believe this was already requested. To me this is a key feature as the copy-paste is not always working as expected.
2) Improvements in copy-paste. It happened to me a couple of times that I paste something on the wrong place and didn’t find the way to redo the paste. It looks like the clipboard is emptied after the paste so, if you undo it, you lose the copied data. This made me lose some selections and makes me now be very careful with the copy-paste.
3) Digest without comments. I think the digest feature has a lot of potential. I use it intensively as a marker without adding comments. When retrieving the digest I see lots of blank spaces and even an option to remove the “marked” text and keep only the comments. I’d love to have it the other way around. A version without comments, so that I can get a summarized version of the book based on the marked text.
4) Improved sensitivity on the toolbar. Not sure of this but I recently got the feeling that, since I upgraded to one of the latest versions, I need to press harder to make a selection on the toolbar (e.g. switch between the pen and the rubber). This is also a bit annoying as sometimes I have to try 2 or 3 times before getting the correct tool. I believe there has to be a way to increase its sensitivity so that’s easier to select.

I hope my comments help to improve this already-amazing device. Thanks for your feedback and great suggestions! Thanks for your sincere feedback and suggestions. Yes,  the function of moving pages to other notes , which is one of the most important features that will be available in the future, each page is independent which should be moved between different notebook freely , that is similar to a binder.   Additionally,  ""a version without comments in digest"" and ""improving the sensitivity on the toolbar"" will all been submitted  to the IT team for further optimization.   Best Regards Thanks for your quick response as usual.

I have two more requests, I've just realized:

1) Be able to remove ""Star Mark"" from the search. When I search for star marks, it finds  stars that are not viewable in the note. What I mean is that I open the note and I cannot find the start mark. I believe maybe a dot or something very small is detected as a star. As I cannot delete it from the note, I believe the best would be to be able to delete it from the search page (e.g. long press to have the option to delete)

2) Select button on the ""compressed"" floating toolbar. The compressed toolbar is a great idea but I miss the selection button, which forces me to extend it. I think it would be great to have it there together with the pen, rubber, do and undo buttons.",A5X feedback after 2 months,title prediction

"Hi Everyone,

I know these kinds of questions have been asked a lot already, but I would still prefer some feedback on my specific use-case. First things first, I am planning on buying a reader and am deciding between the A5x and the Boox Note Air. I want to use the tablet to read academic journal articles while sitting outside in the sun. Now, most of what I will be doing is just reading, though I will generally do some note-scribbling at the side of pages as well. It sounds as if the Lumi Max would be my ideal option, mainly due to its size, but I don't really want to spend $900 on this so I'm stuck between the A5x and the Note Air. Voya, and others, seem to suggest that the Note Air has a slightly better/faster reader, which, I think, would be very important for me. On the other hand, It's a bit more expensive since you have to get an extra pen and, from my understanding, does not have the same Dropbox support that the Supernote has.

Has anybody tackled the question from a similar standpoint? Would really appreciate some more thoughts.

Thanks I have owned the Lumi and the A5X and prefer the A5X because the screen is more crisp (less layers between base panel and your eyes), the pen is better, the annotation features are smart (digest and stars), it feels more durable and notebook-like, and the company is very receptive to feedback. However, Boox devices are very, very fast. Much faster than the Supernote, although I don’t mind the occasional 1-2 second delay in between gestures etc. because I love what the device stands for. The PDF reflow/crop/landscape mode features on the Boox are more advanced than what the Supernote has currently. The Boox Max Lumi and Note Air don’t feel like very well thought out devices, but their capabilities are very powerful if you know what you are doing in the Android ecosystem. 

Tl;Dr: I owned a Lumi and sold it because the text wasn’t very crisp (too many layers on the screen) and the pen sucked. The A5X is a quality, purpose built device with a perfect pen for notetaking and annotating simpler, one-column a4 PDFs but anything more complex and you will meet its limitations very quick. Some thoughts: the Boox Note Air is based on a Carta screen, it has a thin layer of glass and can break quite easily. The A5X (or Note 3) might be more durable.

A5X is more on a minimalist approach even though it's android based. 

I'd say that there is more chances that you get long term support on the A5X, Onyx tends to release new devices and to forget about older ones, that receive no software updates when new models are released. Hard to tell how Ratta will be on the long run on that front, but from what we can read, them seem to be planning to provide upgrades for longer than Onyx.",A5X vs Note Air for PDF annotating,title prediction

Just wondering how it would holdup when the tip would fall on a hard flour i.e. hardwood or paving stone when in garden. I guess time will tell.

I was torn between 6X and 5X. Mobility versus writing space. I intend to transition from A5 paper notebook BJ, of which I started the 7th now, to the SN. Have scanned in the paper BJ's converted to PDF which I intent to import to SN and create a grant index page. Planning to use/utilise/create a template for daily sheet that has some pre-set goal trackers / quotes or at least space for them that should stay on the page  for a whole month or even year as a reminder and without having to flick pages. So space would be already taken up by that and in that respect the A5x made more sense. A5x also allows more flexibility when going to draw concepts/mindmaps/process diagrams etc.

Also looking forward to using this as a learning driver. For example if one wants to learn all chemical elements you could use one layer to show an empty periodic table and then try to fill out all elements and their properties from memory on another layer and the repeat by deleting the 2nd layer without having to re-draw or print out the table structure and all that without  a paper mess and no need for a printer. I have/tried the Galaxy Tab S7 pen, the Staedtler Noris Jumbo, the HoM, and the standard Sn pen.  The HoM is fine, but the one I use most is the standard pen it came with.  I'm still eying the LAMY, for the eraser button.  But It's hard to justify spending another $60-70USD for a 4th pen (I returned the Jumbo).  

I prefer not having to replace nibs.  I do have the same question about ""impact durability"" though.  Thankfully I haven't yet had to find out.  

I really was using a daily planner template with a Tasks, Meetings-at-a-glance, Quick Notes, and Scratchpad page for every day of the year.  I've fallen out of the habit lately though and pretty much have only been using it for meeting notes.  I like your learning driver method. I also just ordered.

"Hi, everyone! I'm wondering about your experience using the proofreading tools on the Supernote.

If so - why start with a Pentagram? Am I able to turn it off in this version? I'd love a auto-draw feature like procreate has. This would make the Supernote so much more useful! It’s in the manual under Symbol recognition I believe. You can search for the star symbols in your notes/documents Thanks for the quick reply. Missed it in the manual apparently.

What I do is draw the star next to the note.  Then, I can later tap on what looks like a table of contents symbol in the top left of the menu bar, and the star symbol in the right corner of that menu, and see all of the pages I've starred in that file.

My only gripes are: 1) it doesn't always recognize the star when I draw it, and 2) it would be great if I could select some of the text what I starred so I could see it in the ToC view instead of have to jump to the page in order to read it.",What's up with the supernote converting a drawn pentagram into a perfectly drawn one?,title prediction

"I wasn't sure whether to write this post or not. I was planning on using an ewriter to organise all my notes and lists at home (I seem to generate 100's of sheets of paper). The problem for me is it's for personal use and so not offset against tax etc which means I'm fairly price sensitive and these things are unfortunately close to the limit of what I'll pay.

Getting unbiased info on these devices is quite difficult. The youtube reviewers were very positive on the A5X but then they were very positive on every ewriter they reviewed which didn't really help me much. I ended up trawling through hours of reviews trying to work out the pros and cons of every device and tried to work out what would suit me best. In the end I chose the A5X as I liked the design, the ease of use and the extra functionality that keeps getting added. 

Two days ago I thought damn it, I'll just buy it. I knew the discount price was finished and had convinced myself that the full price was worth it. Then a shipping charge of $57 got added. I figured I better check the functionality to make sure I'm getting exactly what I want and stopped the order. A day later, I'd got the answers I needed here, and I thought I should still go ahead and place my order. I picked the standard package. OK'ed the shipping price, then was told about possible extra taxes etc to the UK. I gave up at that point.

I'm sure the A5X is great but I can't test it before buying and it seems I can't even work out what I'm I'll actually be paying. I decided not go ahead and instead just rely on paper and pencil for the moment. Hopefully it will appear on Amazon in the future and hopefully I'll be able to afford it. I hear you. It's expensive. All these ewriters are. And it's certainly not essential. It's a tough call. I decided (i.e., believe without actually trying yet) that it will work for what I'm looking for (one thing is to free me from needing to sit in front of my computer to read and annotate long PDFs). But I agree that it would be so much nicer to have a model one could try first. If I were you I'd stay connected here because if a deal on a used device comes available, your best bet for hearing about it will be right here. I decided to go ahead and order (with all the extra shipping and taxes to Canada), because I think this will make a big difference in my workflow (for my actual job).

I definitely intend to use the first 30 days (during which it can be returned for full refund) to see if I like it, and it provides the functionality I want/need. As you pointed out, buying expensive ""toys"" without being able to try them first is a bit of a leap, but I have NO PROBLEMS shipping it back for a refund if I decide it won't work for me. Frankly, if more people insisted on good return policies, I think we'd all feel better about buying new/unavailable tech (since we would have the comfort of knowing that it isn't money flushed down the toilet if it ends up not working for us). I would look for a used one if you are really price-conscious. I bought one used for about $40 under the price of new. You may have to wait a little bit, but it is possible. There is a thread for used ones for sale.

I would look for the thread here that has used devices for sale. Exactly. The A5 (non-X) can sometimes be found at a very decent price, it could be an alternative if budget is important and a more minimalist device can work out fine for your needs, [u/mike\_bike\_kite](https://www.reddit.com/user/mike_bike_kite/)",Information and pricing,title prediction

"Hi,  


I have just watched a [video](https://youtu.be/CXjYHtfDP6A?t=2372) where a PDF, filled with hyperlinks is used almost as if it was an app. I believe this is very similar to the zettelkasten feature which I've read about on the subreddit.

  
This idea got me really excited and upon arriving at the section which shows the PDF on the A5X (which I preordered) it is clearly mentioned and shown that you cannot follow hyperlinks with a single tap. There's always that menu which shows ""Jump To"" which you have to tap again.  
Is it possible to configure this (or change the default) behaviour? If not, I would like to request this :-)  
It should be easy to implement and could very well live alongside the actual zettelkasten feature.

&amp;#x200B;

thanks,

Crucidal [deleted] The inner hyperlinks within the documents are available on Supernote A5X, the prompt of "" Jump to“ ， which designs to avoid unintentional touch which caused to jump to a certain hyperlink page by accident, which might also cause some "" inconvenience"". I agree that there is an inconvenience in both scenarios. However, the touch is not over sensitive and in my experience, being able to hit the hyperlink is enough secure in itself to avoid most unintentional jumping. To me it would be awesome with an option to turn this off, just like you can turn off touch recognition. The power of freedom and customization :) My current experience is purely from e-readers like the kindle paperwhite.(is it fair to assume this would translate to the a5X as well?)I've never experienced unintentional touches there. The palm rejection should ""fix"" other scenarios in which you might accidentally press a hyperlink.It seems like the Jump To was built to prevent ""annoyance"" for a use case that probably rarely happens in comparison to how often you intentionally press it.

Handling unintentional navigation could also be solved by providing a means to quickly go back to the previously shown page. either by a temporarily hovering menu or a built-in shortcut (like double tapping the lower left corner or something)Purely looking at ""handling unintentional navigation"" my suggestion takes 2 page refreshes and that's definitely slower than the ""jump to"" menu. But if you would multiply this by some weight which represents how often you unintentionally navigate vs intentionally, I think it would outweigh the drawbacks :-)","feature request: A5X directly follow internal links without showing ""Jump to"" menu?",title prediction

"Hi r/Supernote. 

&amp;#x200B;

I purchased my Supernote A5X in January and have been using it for a few months now. I absolutely love it. I basically don't use real paper anymore. Over the past several months, my Supernote has become one of my most precious items -- I carry it around with me everywhere. It contains my calendar (actually, Voya's calendar, it's really great!), my todo lists, my personal journal and diary, my work documents, and my school documents and papers. The Supernote team should feel proud that they have created and commercialized such a fabulous device. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to suggest some features, but I don't want to imply that I'm not fully satisfied with the product. The Supernote has brought me alot of joy and I really am happy. In the future, here's what my perfect Supernote device would look like:

&amp;#x200B;

Reading &amp; Note Taking Improvements:

* **Split Screen View.** I wish I could view a document and a note side-by-side at the same time, especially if I turned my Supernote sideways.
* **No annotation tag.** Annotations in PDFs have a small circular ""D"" or ""A"" symbol at the end of each selection that blocks the text underneath. Do we really need these symbols? It would be great to turn them off, or to somehow move them to the side so I can read the text underneath. 
* **Improve the Underlining/Annotating Experience.** When trying to underline a sentence in a PDF, it is too easy to grab (1) the leading whitespace before the first word or (2) the trailing whitespace after the last word or period. It would be great if Supernote was smart enough to omit leading and trailing whitespace characters when underlining.
* **Free the Title.** In a Note, do ""Titles"" really need to be obscured with dark diagonal slashes? What is the point of hiding the text underneath the Title? Perhaps I don't understand this function. Wouldn't it be better if, instead, the text was surrounded by a box that you could see through? Why do I want dark squares in my Note? Why do I want to hide the Title?
* **Change the Lasso Icons.** I feel like the lasso icons are backwards. After I lasso a word or phrase in a Note, the box with a ""T"" in it is *not* for ""Title"" -- it creates a keyword. And the box with ""dots and lines"" is not to create keywords, but to create a ""Title"". I keep getting these mixed up because ""T"" = ""Title"". Am I thinking about this wrong?  I feel like these icons should be swapped, or changed completely.
* **Use UTF-8 Encoding in Digest.** The Digest does no seem to have a full set of UTF-8 fonts. For example, the South Korean won symbol, ₩, does not show correctly in the Digest.

&amp;#x200B;

PDF Improvements:

* **PDF to Note copying.** I want to be able to copy text from an annotation/digest (i.e., the text that I have underlined) and paste it into a Note file.  
* **PDF Snip Tool.** I wish I could lasso an area of a PDF and the copy that over to a Note as an image. 
* **Add Layers to PDFs.** Right now, layers only work in Notes. It would be nice to be able to use layers on top of PDFs. 
* **Copy Written Doodles from PDF to Note.** I wish I could write a little note and/or doodle in a PDF and then cut/copy that into a Note. 
* **Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus.** I want a dictionary and thesaurus feature for PDFs and ePubs (and, Notes?). The Kindle app comes bundled with one, but I can't use that feature outside of Kindle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Potential Bugs:

* **Fix E-mail Typo.** When you enter an incorrect e-mail address (e.g., ""supernote@.com"" is an incorrect e-mail address format) then the error message says ""Please check mailbox"" instead of ""please check e-mail address.""
* **Clean up Keywords.** In a Note, when I lasso a word and mark it as a keyword, it appears as a keyword in the menu. Great. But, when I erase the keyword in the Note, the keyword still appears in the menu. Is that normal? 

&amp;#x200B;

Miscellaneous / Other:

* **Creating geometry.** I want to be able to tap two points on my Supernote device with the pen and have a straight line drawn between them. That's it. That's the feature. I just want to draw straight lines between two arbitrary points. 
* **Creating tables.** I want to be able to tap on my Supernote device with the pen and drag it down to create a table (e.g., a 3x3 or 5x5 or 7x7 table). 
* **Search for Keywords in Digest.** I wish I could search for some text in my Digest (not the notes I make in my Digest, but rather the digest printed text itself). 
* **More Quick Access.** Right now, Supernote only allows 4 Documents and/or Notes in the Quick Access area. I wish I could have a more, especially since adding a 5th document/note completely removes the 1st, and unlinking the 5th does not restore the original 1st. 
* **Quick Access List Reordering.** I wish I could reorder the documents and notes shown in the Quick Access list. But this only makes sense if the documents/notes in the Quick Access area are some how ""sticky"" or ""permanent"". My A5x is scheduled to arrive Monday, and this list looks like a great way to help me get started (in terms of ""things that might not work the way I thought they would""). I hope the supernote team sees this, are they active here? Can you actually ""page"" them so they can be sure to see it? This is a great, carefully considered list of requests and I agree with the vast majority of them.

The biggest one, for me, is the ability to draw straight lines between two points. That would solve a big pain point.

Otherwise, like you, I love this thing. Three months in and it’s now indispensable. Yeah, I use a ruler to draw straight lines, like on pen and paper! xD Super notes does review comments, I was hoping they came out with a calendar with reminders.

Thanks!! Square brackets? These create a separate doc called a digest where you can add your notes relating to that section of the pdf. You click on the text to take you to the digest page.

Received custom import tax payment request via email from DHL on 30. April 7:05 am GMT. Paid right after, process was straight forward. (€129 for Ireland with 23% VAT).

"Hi all

*I posted similar to the below in the remarkable subreddit not realising a5x had a sub.

I'm a Psychologist based in Australia and I'm looking to go digital with my in session note taking. I'm looking for some advice as there's a lot of options.

I think I'm leaning towards the a5x or papyr. I've been watching morning coach and my deep guide most of the morning and it seems that these two devices have improved since release/have good customer service.

How would the a5x go with the below?

Priority
- Note taking/writing is #1 for sure
- Custom note templates (I use a session note template)
- Ability to easily erase what I write
- Ability to export/email my notes to my computer
----- If I could export to a specific folder on my computer that would be ideal
- Ability to create flowcharts/diagrams etc easily as I often use a whiteboard in session

Bonus features
- Would be great if I could export my notes to a specific folder on my computer
- I often put a sticky note on my session note to remind me of things to bring up with the client, but I'm not sure if any device could replicate this?
- Being able to bring up pdfs/highlight and write on them
- Ability to screenshare
- Ability to create a to do list
- Handwriting to text. My hand writing is pretty chicken scratch, but this could be useful in future as I write the same words a lot (so text prediction too)

If anyone has any other suggestions I would be more than happy to hear them. I love my A5X and think it checks off all of your must have boxes and many of your bonus features as well. 

* I really like the writing experience and find it very natural and easy to write on. 
* You can set the note template to be anything you want. There are tons of community created templates and creating custom ones is very simple and straight forward. 
* If you go with the standard or HOM supernote pens, you don't get an eraser button but I don't find it a hassle to switch to the eraser  in the tool bar. I also like the lasso eraser feature a lot and find it easy to use. 
* I have my supernote synced via dropbox. So whenever I choose, all of the files are synced to my computer for reference. You can set up specific folders in dropbox and the files will transfer flawlessly between them. I've never had an easier cloud-syncing experience. 
* I'm not quite sure what you mean by creating diagrams. With Supernote, you are able to draw like you would on a piece of paper. They've hinted at potentially adding drag and drop shapes to notes as well.
* Supernote has several options for marking up and bookmarking documents so you can go back to them later. This might work fo you. 
* You can bring up and write on PDFs. Highlighting is a little strange because its only B/W but it does work.
* Screen sharing is not an option :(
* There are to do list templates and quick access features that make to do lists a breeze to create and update on supernote. 
* I think they are working on handwriting to text for notes but it's not an option yet. 

I cannot recommend supernote enough. I really like the design decisions that Ratta made. The pen loop and aluminum rail system keep the pen and device attached to the folio in a more secure way than magnets do. The writing experience feels great. And the supernote team has been so responsive and listens to the community. This is massively helpful - thank you. You've answered everything so I really appreciate it. I'll have to make though I can avoid using the cloud when it comes to client related notes while still having the ability to export/email them to myself. So I'll ask supernote about that. You can also transfer via usb. 

There is an email function, and I assume that you can send attachments via it (but I haven't used it as I wanted a distraction free device for writing)",Questions on a5x features,title prediction
"Hello Supernote users! I recently updated my Supernote A5X (the day after the newest update came out) and the new features are really great additions. However... the past two days I noticed immense battery drainage. I left my half-charged (give or take) Supernote overnight, waking up to 6%. The day after, left an 85% charged device, only to find it at 55%. Now, this is a HUGE battery drainage problem... and if this is coming from the update, I'm wondering if anyone else had noticed it AND if anyone has considered going down one update for this very reason? As much as I like being able to save my notes as a vector, the last thing I need is my device to feel like my phone, something to constantly be worried about with battery life.

"Hi Can we turn off the jump to request? I have hyperlinked PDF files and I would like to navigate a tad faster by clicking only once?

PS. In love with my A5X xx Our team has discussed this internally. The reason why there is no direct jump is that we lack a shortcut for ""go back"". If the user accidentally triggers the jump, it is inconvenient to return to the previous page. We are developing a convenient way to go back, and at that time, we will enable direct jumps. :) Perfect, thanks ! That's an interesting problem. I know I'm biased here, but I imagine the number of users wanting to go forward with one click far outweighs the number of exceptions of a miss click.

It's just a shame to see videos of the REmarkable clicking through at a high pace for a nice UX feel and the A5X having that friction of double touch...even though you've already built the equivalent capability.

I am being tempted by the Remarkable's texture and pen tool.  Convince me otherwise!

I have ordered the LAMY pen to compare the difference and ordered the Remarkable knowing I can return.  I do a LOT of drawing and my senses are highly sensitive.  I thought I read somewhere about someone who's screen was more textures on. one device than another.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there a way to get a more textured (less slick) drawing experience on the Supernote? Screen protector? Pen?
2. Anyone know if there is a Pencil tool in the works?

(Please know, as much as I am enjoying RM2, Supernote has my heart) No and I don’t know. Just stick with the RM2 if you like drawing. 1.No, you can't add a screen protector because you already have one and you can't remove it because the ceramic pen works with it. For me the first advantage of the ceramic tip is that the tip is thinner.

2) Yes, the pencil brush will be available soon and I look forward to it. The algorithm is done since the beginning of the year, you can see a demo on Supernote's Twitter here :

"I know another one of these threads. I promise I read through as much as I could before posting here but want some fresh perspectives on this given my needs with a device like this.

Both of these devices seem great but I'm torn on which one to get. For my use, I'll only be writing (no drawing or sketching) and I'll primarily be using the device for work meeting notes, to do lists, and daily bullet journaling. I will not use the eReader functionality (already have a Kindle for that) or the PDF viewer/markup functionality. This will be a purely writing device for me. I watched some YouTube videos and both have pros and cons and I can't figure out which one is best for my use. 

The reMarkable 2 looks beautiful and is super thin, which is nice. I also like its UI much better than the Supernote UI - I don't feel like I'll be multi-tasking on a device like this much as I won't be going back and forth between a PDF and notes or anything like that and I don't mind a couple extra presses to get back to my notes (though it looks like rm2's upcoming 2.7 firmware is going to add improved navigation for quickly switching between documents too). The rm2 also has the better OCR, which is something I know I'll use frequently. I already used this often on my Surface to convert handwritten notes. The remarkable 2 also exports writing in a non-rasterized format which is a nice pro. 

The A5X has much better organization options like bookmarks and searching - which would be immensely helpful. The pen is also looking like a huge plus here. I love real luxury pens and own a few fountain pens. So the options Supernote offers are really nice. Plus not ever having to replace the nib is huge and seems like it'd be a nice money save over time. The Supernote also seems to make templates much easier to create and use - which I would for things like my bullet journaling.

My final concerns are price and support. I could use a referral code for the rm2 and get it for over $100 cheaper than the A5X. But I've also heard bad stories of remarkable's support and it's nice to see Supernote engaging with the community. But I also worry that despite that engagement, if something goes wrong I have to send things back overseas which could be expensive or cause long delays (I'm in the US).

Would love to hear the thoughts of people who were trying to decide between the two as well. Especially if you use your device similar to how I described I would above. Thanks! Tough call. Personally, I ended up returning my RM2 and went for the Supernote, see my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/n2ieu3/advice_a5x_vs_rm2/gwyemv3/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Then again, my use case is different.

Why don't you try out the Remarkable and see how you like it? (They offer free returns, after all.)

One thing I'd keep in mind: The writing experience. This is a very personal thing and, personally, I prefer the feeling of the Supernote. &gt; see my comment here

Thanks for that. Helpful. Your points about the areas rm2 wins are also things to consider. Seems like the responsiveness is better. Also the recent 2.6 update seems to have fixed the jagged lines issue on the remarkable. 

&gt; Why don't you try out the Remarkable and see how you like it? (They offer free returns, after all.)

This is a good point. Though I'd feel bad about using someone's referral code only to return the device so they don't get the credit.

Honestly though, if the Remarkable 2 had bookmarks and tags that were searchable it'd probably win for me pretty easily. Though I'd still be lusting after the Supernote's pens and nibs you don't need to replace. I use my device primarily for note taking and planning.  (Consulting on clients). I also purchased both to see which would be better.  SUPERNOTE won.  For me it came to writing, my handwriting needed a .5 and the RM2 was not fine enough and when I switched to the pencil thin, it was too light and hard to read.  As much as I liked the look and feel, it was a deal breaker.  Also, the nib replacement just seemed a hassle.  Love the durability of Supernote.  Supernote can save to cloud or OneDrive which I like, but there is a lot more storage on Supernote than RM2.
Would like to see more “helpful” hints from the company but right now the 3rd party people are doing a nice job for me.
Hope this helps! Thanks. I appreciate this perspective. The pen is a huge reason why I'm still unsure which one to go with. The Supernote's pens all seem superior to anything else on the market - both in feeling like a real pen and also the thinness of the nib. Definitely something I'm putting a lot of weight behind. But so much else about the rm2 seems better for my use cases.",Supernote A5X or reMarkable 2?,title prediction

"Hello Supernote team!  
I just recently purchased a used Supernote device and love the fact that you promote the second hand market for Supernote devices, instead of trying to squash it (I am looking at you Apple!). The ability to buy and sell Supernote devices is amazing because it not only gives a Supernote buying ""*insurance""*  that they can sell the device if it does not work for them, or help those who cannot pay full price afford one, but it also helps keep ewaste out of the landfills.   


That said, while going through the process of finalizing a deal there we were a couple things that concerned/annoyed me though.   
1. Very few rules - Normally anytime you are buying and selling something on Reddit the subreddit has strict rules that help prevent scams. Some of these include recent timestamped photos, addition to the universal scammer list, only allowing payment through paypal goods and services, having the buyer/seller say which state they live in, and a flair that shows how many trades a user has. A perfect example of these rules is r/hardwareswap and r/AVexchange. Implementing some of these rules would greatly help everyone avoid scams.  


2. Hard to find people selling - People who were selling their devices often not only used the trades mega thread but also made new posts or commented on other posts. This caused an issue where it was hard to know if you were seeing all the people interested in selling their devices or not.   


3. Vague price history - Often times the original post showing the final sale price was gone so it was hard to determine what a good deal was or not. Making sure these stay up would greatly help everyone know they are getting a good deal. 

4. Sellers not including screenshots or condition - Most of the time sellers did not include a link to pictures/timestamps of their device so it was hard to detriment what exactly they were selling in what condition.   


Ways to implement these suggestions:  
I think that the best possible way to keep the Supernote market safe and avoid blocking out other content in this subreddit is to create a new subreddit specifically for buying/selling/trading Supernote devices. This new subreddit would then be added to the USL (universal scammers list) and would have strict rules on how people can make posts. Any person who wanted to buy/sell a device could then make a post and the seller/buyer could sort these posts by new in the subreddit getting an up to date list of the resent buying/selling requests. Flairs could be added to further improve the process with Buying, Selling, and Closed tags being used to show the status of a post. Lastly, each post would be able to include pictures and a detailed title so that the buyer and seller can meet quickly and effectively.  


Thanks so much for reading our feedback! I hope this post is helpful. Thank you for sharing your opinion with us, to avoid scams and make our users can get a Supernote device through a trustful channel is our wishes. Hope our users can be more cautious and prudent during the transactions of a used device. What we can do is limited at this stage, look forward to a chance to discuss more with you in the future.

"I've had an issue with my Supernote A5 since I got it almost a year ago and I was wondering if anybody else had the same problem.

I cannot charge the device with a USB-C to USB-C cable. It works fine with the included USB-A to USB-C cable, and with any other A to C cable I've tried. But if the cable is USB-C on both ends (like the MacBook charger) absolutely nothing happens. I've tried this with multiple cables and multiple transformers with the same (lack of) results.

Does anyone else have this issue, or do I have a faulty device? This is frustrating because it means I need a dedicated charger for my Supernote, while the rest of my devices (laptop, phone, keyboard, etc) can all charge from the same cable. If it is a problem with the device, is there any way to get a fix or replacement? Bit surprised you haven't contacted CS if it's been happening for almost a year. I think there were a few customers who had problems with the included cable last year but it can't be that if you've tried multiple cables and chargers. 

Feedback to customer service, via your device, is your best course of action. There are the usual things to try, hard reset, swapping cable around, clean the port (but then you've got it to work with USB-A) etc or it could be a software fault. I'm sure they'll help you resolve your problem I was actually waiting until I got around to getting another cable and adapter to test it out before contacting customer service, and to make sure it wasn't just something about the the USB hardware they use.

I'll contact them, thanks.

I use my Supernote A5 for a lot of grading, and overall it works great for getting feedback to students. I don't use Google Classroom but I can speak to the other aspects of the workflow.

The workflow is a little awkward, however. It's easy enough to get a folder full of PDFs of the student submissions onto the device and to mark them up. But because the Supernote wants to leave the original PDF untouched, you need to export each marked-up document individually (as far as I know there is no way to export an entire folder in one action). This takes usually betweeen 5 and 30 seconds per document depending on its length, which interrupts the grading flow a bit. The exported files are in a totally different directory, named the same as the original document. I usually end up manually copying these files somewhere to be uploaded back to my LMS.

I would **love** it if they implemented an ""export entire folder"" option, or else if there were some way to have the exporting of marked-up PDFs happen automatically in the background.

There might be a smoother workflow with Word .docx files if you get an X-series Supernote.

Still, the Supernote has made marking up student papers and essays *much* easier overall. I no longer need to either (a) print them all out or (b) fiddle with PDF markup on my computer.

Hope this helps a bit! Thank you. This definitely helps! How do your students feel about your comments? Are they able to see and read them easily? Aside from my bad handwriting, yes!

The annotations are a bit pixelated but nobody seems to have had an issue yet. Also, I think the pixelation issue has been solved on the X-series with vector-based exports (which is allegedly coming to the A5 … *eventually*?)",Question about use with Google Classroom/Drive,title prediction
" Hi! Since this morning I’m having a problem when trying to update my a5x, and some more issue. When I try to update it (I’m still at 238 version), through settings&gt;system&gt;software update&gt;check, it just tells me the device is updated. Wifi connection, of course, is on, and I can check my email, but I cannot synchronize though supernote cloud, because when I try, it immediately opens the last doc I read. And finally, if I try to upload the log (system&gt;feedback&gt;upload logs), it tells me “upload failed”. I restart and reboot 3 times, and no variations. Please, give me some indications about what I’m supposed to do. Thanks It should've updated around two weeks ago. My advice is to contact customer service via email and include your device number.

" Thanks a lot! Very good video as always :) I agree with you, it may be missing an option to choose the type of eraser but anyway we will enjoy it ! Just have to be patient for the ""X"" owners. I'm using the 5X this morning, and really miss the erase gesture already! lol Could you tell us if this gesture is possible to execute while holding the device in one hand and writing with the other? Or are you forced to put down the device on your lap or table? I wonder if this specific use case was a part of the troubleshooting when Supernote developed this gesture, u/mulan_sn or u/hex2asc? I've been trying to imitate the gesture on my A6X, but find it a bit difficult to find a natural/working way for two fingers to touch while holding the device in my left hand and the pen in my right hand. The whole premise of the two finger gesture suggests that you have a free hand available in the first place but it's *not impossible* to get two fingers on the screen using the hand holding the device. 

However, as stated from your own trial, it's really awkward and very uncomfortable to get the finger positioning right to successfully activate the function. 

The developers have done a lot of work to refine the gesture and activation zones to prevent as much accidental or false positive activation as possible due to extra stray fingers on the screen including the writing hand making contact with the screen while writing.",Supernote A5 and A6 UPDATE!

"I was just eagerly waiting for my Supernote to be shipped. The long waiting time is not great but is something I understood but I had to cancel my order 3 days before shipping since I looked randomly into the return policy.  Not free return policy and good will return for such devices is just not what I expect. Do you by any chance live in the US?

I read complaints about a lack of free international returns but tbh that's not the norm where I live and, I think, a lot of the world... so calling it *a joke* is a bit harsh and a little US (and maybe EU?)-centric. If I bought a Remarkable, for example, their free return policy wouldn't apply to me since I live in Asia. I guess I would wait for them to set up US/EU warehouses for cheaper shipping in your case.

Edit: The only places I know of here with free international returns are big companies like Lazada (owned by Alibaba; think Amazon) that do logistics in massive volume. How long does this company take to ship? I ordered my A6 X four days ago and have yet to receive a confirmation email. I have only gotten the PayPal receipt. I know they are supposed to have good customer service, but I would at least like to know that my order is being processed. Usually ships within a few days and as far as I remember they sent me a despatch email ( though that doesn't always mean the parcel is physically with the carrier.) I do remember that the tracking was slow to update. See whether anything comes through by Monday then pop them an email to check. Could be they're just busy. Appreciate that we'd all like a free return. However, some people buy it just to try it out, some order at least two devices from different companies with the sole intention of only keeping one. They are a relatively new company, so if a lot of people send devices back, they're losing money. Perhaps, one day they'll be in a position to but likely it could increase the cost for others.

There is the option of selling it, as others have done.

Method 1: Then click the PDF on the cloud page, it will automatically download the exported PDF after clicking and converting (with the .mark files)   
  
Please do not download from the cloud directly without the above steps, otherwise, it is possibly to download the original “blank” pdf without annotations.  
   
Method 2: You can also open/click the exported pdf with annotation from the My device-&gt; Export folders, (The exported pdf will be downloaded automatically)  
  
Additionally，when exporting the PDF on the device, whether you choose “original” or “Vector”. For a vector pdf, If the pdf parsing software cannot open it ( or open without annotation), please try to open it directly with a browser.  
Not sure that whether it is clear enough, please try it. It worked - Thank you!!

Mike I don't have my device yet - it's currently in transit from China. So I can't help you with the first couple. But the pen is not magnetic. They recommend you use the case because it has the pen holder loop on the side for it. 

And as far as I know, the Kindle app only lets you connect to the Kindle service. I'm *pretty sure* you have to use the built in reader to read epub and pdf files you transfer to the device. 1- You don't need the Kindle app to view ebooks. Kindle app is only for accessing kindle books. Supernote can read most ebook formats. Edit: To use LAN, you need the Supernote Partner App.

2- You can put those files anywhere. But the ideal place to do it is in the Documents folder. Putting them in the Notes folder may cause some confusion.

3- Check your email or spam for a privacy or insecure connection alert to enable it.

4- No. You can keep the cap in the pen loop. If you have the standard pen and not HOM, it will be roomy in the pen loop. Many thanks.

Don't suppose you know why the USB won't connect? It seems I can write to the supernote cloud drive and then sync.

"Hello

I have supernote A5x and A6x. I need the two devices to have the same content.

I'm logged in on both devices with the same account (email address). They are not mirroring. on the ratta supernote cloud, it only shows the A6x's content

I've tried to log out and log in on A5x: doesn't work... 

what do I have to do ? Curious about this question myself.  Thinking of getting an A6X for the smaller form factor.  But if they are treated as completely discrete devices and there are no seamless integration options, despite them sharing the same email account, why not consider a non-Sn as a second device just for variety? X series can share the same account(login with one account), while the non-X series can share the same account. You can log in on your new device with your existing Supernote account.  
  
Users need to be careful to keep both devices in sync with each other. Generally, the steps are like following:  
1: A6X writes notes  
2: A6X  sync  
3：A5X sync  
4: A5X writes notes again.  
.......  
Repeat the above steps

I second this. I have an A6X and A5X and they sync with each other fine. Same for me. I have A5X and A6X, and the content syncs fine.

Re Google. Sure it's been mentioned/requested, so believe it'll be possibility in a future update but don't take this as gospel. I work with two devices A5x and A6x, and they can be synced if you what entails correspond to your needs:

1. **Sync is manual, and therefore, not real time**. That means that when you do a change on your device you need to do **every time** you want to use ""collaborative"" documents.
   1. press the sync button on the top drawer, to check if any change has been made since the last sync by someone else
   2. make the changes you need to do
   3. press again the sync button to make sure what on the cloud mirror the content of your device
   4. hoping that no one is doing the same on another device (see 3 below)
2. **Sync does sync the notes but not the ""smart annotation""**. See here point 3, on my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/nnr2nv/do_annotations_exist_outside_my_a5x_or_a6x_device/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). If that's what you need upvote the post linked.
3. **Sync granularity is the file level**, I think, but unsure. I, personally, notice that if I want to sync two devices at the same time, there is an alert on the second one, saying that the cloud is already busy syncing on another device. **What I fear it means is that** : during the time device A is syncing (making some useful changes; let's say to your task list), you can't sync. Then, when the cloud is done syncing A, you start syncing your device B. If, for some reason, the changes you made to the task list on device B is ulterior to the one made on device A, that (probably) means, you'll overwrite changes made by device A, **losing device A changes**.

Based on these remarks, and the fact that you have a team of 8 people (imagine this hassle is x8), **I would recommend going for a device that as a granularity of stroke change, and is in ""real time""**.

If you want to stay in e-inks, I would therefore recommend looking **Mobiscribe Origin: MobiShare**. Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/K35CFZlKC9M) testing the sharing capabilities.

"Thank you for the new firmware update. It adds some very useful features.

Is there any way that you could add pressure sensitivity adjustment/calibration in a future update? I have several styli which I find more comfortable than the Supernote stylus and the default pressure sensitivity is far too high for them. 

Also, in a previous firmware version, the button on a Lamy EMR stylus triggered the selection erase tool when held down. It now does nothing. Can this be re-instated as it was a very useful feature? The eraser on other styli still works fine.

"Since A6X is on Android, I *supposed* we can install Microsoft OneNote app, and take notes directly into MS OneNote.  Supernote, can you please comment if this is possible? Yes, As it's an Android device, you may do that. But you have to wait a few months. At the beginning, we will block any third-party APP until A6X runs stability.

And I should inform you that handwriting latency will increase by using OneNote. Because of slow refresh rate of E Ink Screen, Supernote's note app access the display layer directly. We call this EPA technology (EPaper Accelerator) while OneNote does nothing special for that.

We will not exclude attempts to install third-party applications, and we will establish an application store to encourage users to help us collect applications suitable for ink screens.

For us, our main goal is to develop note-taking application, which needs to be adapted to the disadvantages of gray scale display, low refresh rate and so on. It should perform better than other apps while runs on E Ink Device.

So I think you will have opportunity to try both solutions, from MS or from ours. :) Hi Bruce!

Thanks for the transparent insight :) I agree about your view about the technology and the consumer demands and I hope that your decision will pay off.

One of my concerns with Android as an OS of choice is the latency. Can you say that there will be no decrease in latency (even better, an improvement) with using Android? (The EPA tech sounds great!)

Also, as it is an Android-based software, is it okay to expect some basic functionalities as Web browser, keyboard pairing, etc?

I am really happy that your company is very communicative. Can't wait to join the fam! (would be super cool if you'd have a EU warehouse ;) ) Appreciate the communication and transparency in this.  :)

Perhaps another way for me would be to OCR it in A6X's note taking app, and then export it to OneNote then. This is a good idea!  If we plan to export doc/docx format, why not add one more format as OneNote. We will check that if we can do.",Will A6X be able to sync to Microsoft OneNote?,title prediction
"Is there a reason that Supernote have sent 8 emails about their A6X pre-order offer in the last 30 minutes? There doesn’t appear to be an option to unsubscribe either, which is a bit naughty these days?

Personally, although I really do want to get a Supernote A6X , I’m not going to pre-order anything until I see something a bit more concrete than some screen shots. Not the most thought-out piece of sales literature. Where are the specs, has the latency improved, what are the differences between A6 and A6X...... anything?!  Eight emails,  It's very high treatment. I think they see you as a big buyer. :) We should say sorry, It seems they send everyone 8 emails... It's our mistake.

"Anyone else feel that they are really missing the ability to search for a specific word in their handwritten notes?

I primarily would use this device to take meeting notes. That is the reason Im holding back from buying at this point. SUPERNOTE doesn't have the ability to search hand written notes at this time. However the A6X migth have the ability when it comes out but for mi used I think is too small I need the A5 with that fuction. I really think that constraint is that they don't have OCR readily on their Linux OS (on the other hand, it's one of the main features of the Remarkable). As a consequence, one cannot really map the handwriting to the alphabets for searching..

Prolly also that the software is originally introduced in Chinese/Japanese, so English support is minimal.

Maybe Android will change things as there are lots existing solutions out there. Let's see =) But do you personally feel that you need to search through your notes sometimes? Of course! It's also on my wish list as well. But I could imagine it not being on the top of their priority especially the introduction of the new OS.

"Was quite interested in getting an A5 but was really put off by the fact that there is no way of returning an opened device. I have bought devices in the past that might have worked well for others but just didn't suit me. And so, in less than a few days, they were returned. Given that there is no place for me to try the device, I think it's pretty unfortunate there is no return option. I understand they are a small company that's just starting out but I'd also have been okay if they charged a restocking fee. 

How do you guys feel about their no return policy? Just wanted some different perspectives. I understand your concerns. Our marketing department will internally discuss the return policy in order to better serve our users, especially those early customers who find us. Thank you very much for kind understanding.

As for return policy, we assume Supernote buyers are familiar with E-paper device and operation system and here are reasons we put the policy.

Some customers had impulse buy with less consideration of the need they really want. We would like to avoid such lose-lose result.

We have been suffering by free return policy for some surprising reasons, such as

\- The display size is too small or too big

\- No color display

\- Just dislike it anymore

\- Need some cash back urgent for other

Please understand that we provide one-year warranty with free replacement and DHL delivery for obvious malfunctions or defects as a responsibility to customers, but we cannot afford for nonsense return. We fully understand that most customers are reasonable and kind, but things keep happening. We are a young company doing all we can to improve our product for people's daily lives.

We know this is never a cheap purchase so we appreciate every customer who places order and uses Supernote to make daily life more efficient and meaningful as our 4F slogan: Feel &amp; Find, Free &amp; Fun. It’s not great, especially when they are expecting customers to purchase, at least at the moment, based on a “goodwill” policy, in that there is hardly any info at all available on the A6X. 
I dunno about anyone else, but I would always try and get as much info as possible on something that was going to cost me several hundreds of pounds, but that info isn’t available. I really do understand that there will be timewasters, people who don’t like the colour, etc, but you’d like to think those were in the minority. The point made about a restocking fee seems fair, perhaps something along the lines of even half the purchase price, so it would sting if you sent it back,(for non-defect reasons, obviously ), but wouldn’t be a complete loss for either side?
I’m waiting for two things before purchasing the A6X, one is more information, videos, specs etc and the other is a European distributor so I don’t end up having to pay a third of the price in shipping and taxes! That's a really disappointing reply that I think you copy/pasted from somewhere else in this thread or your website (so no real discussion?). I have mentioned maybe even instituting a restocking fee to discourage frivolous returns from customers. You haven't addressed that. None of the examples you mentioned (why people return devices) capture the writing experience, that's the one thing we can't test by watching videos. ""the no returns due to a small percentage of potentially bad customers"" approach doesn't reciprocate the goodwill you seem to be expecting from your customers. 

Anyhow, you guys are allowed to run your company however you think is best and I wish you all the best for that.",No returns on opened devices?,title prediction

" Thanks, good share.  I understand Mandarin (Chinese) so here are some takeaways:

Looks like there are some interface changes on the tool bar and also the way the notes are displayed.

10:40 - The Lamy pen feels the same as the 1st generation heart of metal pen (Plastic nib). The reviewer said there's a bit of ""stickiness"" feeling when writing.  He feels that the 2nd generation ceramic nib feels better when writing. 

12:20 - He was comparing the Weixin ebook reading app, I think.  He mentioned the speed seems to be comparable with another ebook reader and looks nice.  Chinese Font on the A6X seems to be smaller and doesn't seem to have a setting to change that in the Chinese ebook reader app he is using.  

13:37 - He mentioned the writing experience is quite good.  Will be continuing further reviews as he uses the A6X in the coming weeks. Thanks so much! I received one. 
I can do a quick video if that helps.

Can confirm the stickiness of the Lamy nib, don’t have ceramic to compare. 

Shout your questions and I’ll answer :) Thanks! :)  Can you please share your experience of the ebook reading?  Things I'm looking at:

\- Table of content

\- Annotations: is it easy (just write directly?)

\- Can you export annotations easily?

\- Can you still draw a line across the screen and then do note taking split screen?

\- Press-and-hold on a word for dictionary (is it available yet)?

"I have a Onyx Boox with note taking from work, but the A6X appeals to me.  However, I've found it very hard to make pencil-like sketches due to the lack of pressure sensitivity to opacity on the Onyx.  Though the brush gets thinner with low pressure, it's still 100% pure black.

Most of the first pre-orders have been shipped and many customers in Japan, China, Europe and the U.S. have already received the A6 X. We look forward to you sharing your creations on the A6 X!

1. The region selection edit tool affects the erasing effect.

2. Margins are too large (EPUB)

3. Confusion caused by two different entrances, the right tag bar and the file manager.

Personally, I want to have one of those eink device to take notes at work, read epub pdf and blogs. So the only think really missing on A5 is the browser.

Any thoughts on that?

For the A5, it is harder to integrate a browser, but out of concern for our users, we will try out as many solutions as possible, without guaranteeing results. If the browser is crucial to you, ""X"" series could be a better option at this stage.

"Hi, I've just updated my A6X with the C.063 firmware. Thank you for the correction on the selection tool after the erasing action. It works. 😊

I wanted to tell you I found the following bugs:

- Eraser: with the previous version, when I chosed the ""region eraser"" or used the eraser on the Lamy pen I could delete just a part of a continuos stroke, just the area I selected. With the update I can only erase a complete stroke, even if I select just a part of it. And if I choose the ""regular eraser"" I cannot change its thickness, even if I go to ""pen"", change its thickness and then ""regular eraser"", it is always small.

- Folders: I still find the confusion we had on the previous version, but now I know that if I want to see the files stored in a folder I have to use the side bar, go to Inbox and then select the folder I need. It would be just great if I could see my files even if I choose for example ""Documents"" or ""Notes"" on the side bar and then select the correct folder.

- Png: I don't know why, but when I select a png file, the device tells me ""Unsupported file format"". I can see the thumbnail, but can't open it. It happened also with the previous version.

I know you are working hard on further updates, so maybe you are able to add some of these amendments.
And thank you for this amazing device! Hey there,

Thank you for your detailed feedback.

Eraser: To improve user-friendliness, we are optimizing the region erasing algorithm for a smarter approach.

Folders: in this release we have only tweaked the UI to reduce confusion and will bring subsequent improvements in later updates.

One option to go around this problem is to use the star mark. You basically draw a star on a page and the device recognizes it. After, you can search for star marks in any note document you have and it will display small sized pages where you have a star. Therefore, if you underline some important keyword on a page with one of these marks, you can find that word with no problem. So it's still better than a regular paper notebook. Also consider that you don't have to use paper or carry tons of notebooks with you. Everything is in one device. It is fast, good to write on, and everything is tidy and accessible.
I have been using A5 device everyday for roughly a month now. I use it as a notebook and (mostly) as a PDF reader. Besides the very good writing experience, fast processing, etc., the best part is that I don't use paper anymore and everything is cleaned and organized from the beginning. I would recommend it.
That being said, if you really need a handwritten notes conversion function and don't want to tackle the problem by the means that supernote offers, there may be other devices on the market more suitable for you. Yes, we have the same idea as you. So we made a similar function in A6X. My colleague will post a video later, please confirm if this is what you want.

Once this function is approved by our users, we will apply it to A5/A6. Hi there, you can convert your handwriting to text and set it to keywords for easy searching and indexing.

"Do you guys think that this would be possible? I use OneNote for **a lot** of things and it would be so awesome if SuperNote could sync with them. :-)

I thought of this after my integration with Dropbox completely broke on my A5. Maybe another idea would be to add more slots for quick access? I keep a lot of my notebooks separate and having more than 4 items in the quick access bar would be a gamechanger for me. If this feature comes through Supernote would make an immediate impact on the professionals market (potentially grabbing a chunk of it from iPad). I see OneNote used in the industry a lot, yet very few who use it write up the notes on iPad. In my area we use ordinary notebooks and then retype the notes in OneNote (it is considered unprofessional to type notes in a customer meeting). If I had this sync - that would be the feature I'd be using hte most.  


The key thing though - it should support the corporate sharepoint accounts somehow (OneNote can use sharepoint as the sync backend). Completely agree! None of these devices have that functionality so it would really cater to a very specific target market. Posted this sometime back.  They replied:

"I have had a Supernote A5 for close to two months now, and overall I love it. It has changed the way I work and has made me much more productive.

 However I have been surprised at the poor quality of the images in exported notes. It seems like they export as raster images at the same resolution as the Supernote screen. When I view them on a larger, higher-resolution computer screen the lines look very jagged and pixelated, and zooming in on a note makes this worse (see the attached doodle).

Is there a reason that Supernote does not export to PDF with a vector-based image, like I believe the reMarkable does? I believe this would help the notes look much more legible and clear when read on a computer.

"I wish to use one for home and another for work, but would like both to sync from the same Dropbox account.

I mainly use notes and would like notes to sync on both devices. Interesting question. How do you think the sync should work? My understanding of the sync process is that it doesnt sync unless i explicitly pulldown then top nav bar and hit the sync button.

So, for simplicitly/Minimum Viable Product, i think they should let the end users control sync i.e. if there is a sync conflict (i.e server file updated by another device), they provide the option to a) retain file on device, overwrite on server (cloud) b) retain file on server, overwrite on device. Yes,you can.
And one more thing need to know is that  a6x is trying a new note file format which differently with ""none x"" series(A5,A6). So if you sync one of A5/A6 type with another of A6X type. Each one would fail to open the note file created by another.

"Just got the A6X today and I have to say that as a person who much prefers pen over pencil, it is really nice to write with. I've had the rM1 for about 4 months now and here's my initial thoughts comparing the two. (Background - I'm part designer and researcher and I make things with my hands so I'm very sensitive to the tools I use)

Screen - I thought that the A6X's 300dpi screen would mean that the lines I write would be less pixelated and smoother-looking than the 226dpi of the rM tablet but that's not the case. 

Size - I thought the smaller 7.8"" diagonal screen size would feel like I'm losing out on screen real estate. I don't feel that way because of the finer tip on the pen. The size is more portable than the rM dimensions and I feel like I can take it everywhere with me.

Pen - It's a comfortable weight to write with. The style reminds me of the Pilot Razor Point felt tip pen that I used to use a lot. The finer nib and the feeling that I can press as hard as I need to is mentally relieving. I did not realize how hard I write until I've switched back to pen and paper after using the rM1. The standard rM1 marker feels to me like trying to write with a hollow plastic tube. I also have the LAMY AL-Star and that feels too bulky for my medium-large hand with skinny long fingers. Sometimes when I press the button on it a short line appears out of nowhere on the rM1. I don't have any mods on my rM1.

Writing feel - Wow. Everyone's been saying it's hard to describe. Here's my attempt. My go-to paper for writing is very smooth, about 25% of the way to glossy paper, and I usually use the Muji retractable pen, the one that looks like the Sarasa retractable pen, 0.5mm. It's a ballpoint. Compared to that, writing on the A6X is like if the ballpoint is not rolling, but instead it's gliding. The sound of writing is quieter than the rM, which is quieter than pen on paper. It sounds like you're writing on paper with a smooth paper texture, but that's if you're writing with a light hand. The harder you press down, you'll get less of that scratchy sound. When you first put the pen to the A6X screen, you'll hear a tap sound kind of like Apple Pencil on iPad but quieter. It's louder if you're holding the pen at an angle, and quieter if you're writing on it such that the pen is tangent to the surface (or orthogonal or uhhh straight down for the laymen terms). The rubber texture provides more resistance the harder you press when writing. If you press too hard, it's a lot of friction. But that means that you get more haptic feedback if you're going slow and trying to be precise in your lines. If you're pressing hard and want to write fast, it's gonna feel like too much friction. On that note, I can see the indent of the lines on the screen surface when I write hard and it quickly disappears. So that's good. 

Colors - the A6X has 4 colors. White, light gray, dark gray, and black. I don't see myself using the white one very much. Compared to the rM1 which has white, gray, and black (and light gray for highlighter), this means that I can use the A6X for planning website layouts. Light gray would be content boxes and then darker gray can be non-text content. I would fill in actual content with black. 

Switching between tools - It's nice that it's only one tap to switch to the highlighter or marker(?) on the A6X. On the rM1, this requires two taps and then reading from the list to pick what you want to use. Unless you've got the positions all memorized. For me, this means that it is faster to write headings and highlight important content so that I can structure my notes clearly and visually. 

Interface and some features - It's not as obvious how to get to the Settings menu like on the rM interface. You have to know to swipe down from the top and the mini tutorial at the beginning does not cover that. I love the lasso select text as a heading for a table of contents. That way, I don't have to look through the pages to find what I'm looking for. Compared to the rM1, this means that I will not have to create a new notebook for each topic or subtopic. I can just select the text to be a header. 

Cover - I got the default cover. The front cover feels a bit too lightweight and it wiggles around easily. I can see where the round magnet is on the inside of the front cover, which is not a problem. 

Questions - 

1. I'm trying to sync with Dropbox. There's no new folder on my Dropbox or I can't find it. Do I need to have a Supernote account for this to work? I'm hoping I don't need that. 

2. I'd like to use the nib in a different pen chassis. I was able to unscrew the front piece near the tip but can't seem to get the nib out. Can I even do that with this updated ceramic version?

3. I made a test notebook that's just 2 pages of scribbles. Why is it 2MB? I like that it does tell me how big the file is but I imagine if I have 100 pages, it may be 100MB. So about 2000 pages would be 1GB. So the 22GB of user space I have on the A6X would give me like 44,000 pages. Much less than the rM's advertised 100,000 pages on 8GB. 3. I wrote about the file size as well and the support team replied saying that they will fix that issue in future updates. They said that they are well aware of the issue and they have a potential fix that will be part of one of the future updates. 
Hopefully that future update will be before you reach the 44,000 page limit? Lol just kidding 😅 

Enjoy your A6X, I think its a marvelous tool with an equally amazing &amp; very active team behind it. Cheers. Thanks! Glad they’re going to fix the issue. 

I quite enjoy it so far, much more than I have enjoyed my rM1 in the past months. I think I may have found the right one for me. To read your notes in Dropbox, first export them als pdf or png.

"Had a quick question-what type of charger is recommended for charging my A6X to have better battery life. I read in Onyx Boox posts that fast charging was causing lot of battery issues. 

Is it ok to charge my A6X with a fast charger? Or should it be a small charger? Or a computer perhaps (as the package did come just with a cable and no plug 🔌) 

Want to keep my Supernote for ever 😁 A6X support USBPD (the main fast charge standard). It's a negotiation protocol. When plugged, the charger will ask A6X, ""how much current you want?"", and A6X always answer,""1.5A is enough"". So the charger will start supply current limited by the agreement. You need not worry about too much current would damage the device. Typically A6X will get full charged in 2 hours by a 7.5W (or more powerful) PD charger. 

If you want to use a fast charger, please make sure it's PD type.

It's also ok if you use a computer USB port for charge, it will take more time than PD charger, at about 3-6 hours. Because of computer USB port usually limit the current supply at 0.5A-1A level. Perfect explanation! Thank you",Type of Charger to Use,title prediction
"Hi! Question for the supernote team, after the holidays. 

Are any of the following features on the roadmap? (I understand the hardware roadmap is delayed for bug squashing and UI integration across devices, so it could be a while, but would love to know if they’re at least in the works or in planning.)

1. Frontlight (ability to set brightness at the least, ideally also warmth)
2. Waterproof/water resistant

3. Work with calibre wirelessly* (content server or companion app)


* actually, as I’m still having trouble getting my A5 set up to work with my PC at all via usb cable, I’m not 100% sure it works with the calibre desktop software that way. Does it? If not, that’s definitely a feature request, too.  


Thanks! Our holiday is coming to an end, but I have been on duty during the holiday

1. About the front-light.

When the E Ink screen was first put on the market, it was necessary to add an auxiliary light source due to the low contrast. However, the current contrast gets better and does not require front-light. In products whose main purpose is note-taking, removing the front-light is a common way.

However, some brands with a history of making eReaders continue to use front-light. The reason is that it can be used in places without lights, such as at night. My question is why not turn on the lamp?

Our focus is on a good handwriting experience, writing on a shiny screen will not be an enjoyable experience. 

We use the ""hard pen and soft film"" technology to simulate the effect of paper. If the front-light layer is added, the distance from the pen tip to the display layer will increase. So we would rather give up the front-light feature.

2. About waterproofing

We will not use waterproofing on the ""X"" series (A5X/A6X), but we will consider supporting waterproofing on the successor products of the ""non-X"" series

3. About USB

If you use MAC PC, you need to install the software openMTP to support USB connection. If it's not cause by this, please contact our customer service. Thanks for another quick and thorough reply. I’m consistently impressed by your presence in this subreddit.

1. I sometimes like to work and to read in bed while my spouse is asleep. That said, yes, I could leave the bedroom or perhaps use a smaller external book light. That’s a great point about adding a light lessening the writing experience.

2. Interesting, thanks!

3. It’s a laptop running Windows 10. I’ll do a bit more troubleshooting on my end and then reach out if I still can’t figure it out.

Thank you again. I enjoy this work because I like to communicate with others, especially for interesting idea to make product better. Another reason is I want to improve my English skill since I'm from the place where the mother language isn't English.

I'm happy to learn a new phrase ""reach out"" from your message.

So don't be hesitate to reach out with any question:) &gt;Our focus is on a good handwriting experience, writing on a shiny screen will not be an enjoyable experience.

I totally understand this, but the device can \*also\* be used for reading: and improving the reading experience in low light setting can be nice, don't you think so? It would also improve the perceived contrast of the screen (that's the magic behind the ""paperwhite"").

Eink screens did improve, but the background is still kinda grey. With an optimal lighting and a document with good contrast it's fine, but if that's not the case a frontlight can help. A lot. If it can be shut down, what problem would it create? Is the distance to the display layer so big that the writing experience would be really different?

"My boss was enamored enough of my A6X to buy one for herself, and for her birthday I got her a Heart of Metal pen.  She loves it, so here's a review:

""The pen is STURDY.  I don't feel like the cap is going to pop off if I drop it.  It makes a solid ""click"" when snapping it back on and I love that it's thicker than the standard pen because I prefer writing with wider barreled instruments.  It writes just as perfectly as the standard pen.  No charging required.  I don't know how long the nib will last but the packaging included easy instructions for changing it and I've had the standard for months without any degradation so I don't expect to be changing it any time soon.   Fits snugly on the case's loop and I don't worry about it coming off in my bag."" 

So obviously she gives it 5 stars, lol!  I'll be buying one for myself eventually if I get tired of the LAMY one. Totally agree; I also have the HoM pen, bought it along my A5. It solves the problem I had with my previous eink notepad; as an university student, I write a lot and the nibs would wear off way too fast. Now I can write probably till the end of the world :D So happy.

"I just got both of these delivered today I was in batch 3 for the remarkable 2

Here are my observations as a notebook doodler. I wanted a device that I could take outside and do some sketching and people studies and just generally be able to do rough logo concepts and first stage illustration layouts, like I usually do in my paper notebook. I am a biro scribbler rather than pencils so... here are my observations.

Surface feel - the biggie :) well remarkable has this won hands down. You start drawing on this and you just smile. Man it really does feel and sound like you are drawing on paper. It is absolutely incredible. The supernote definitely doesn’t feel like paper it feels like writing on rubber or a piece of Lino with a biro, as you press harder you can feel the pen almost carving into the surface. It doesn’t feel bad but it definitely doesn’t feel like paper. So if you are just looking for the most realistic paper feel then go get the remarkable 2

Drawing experience - the remarkable 2 has a large range of pens pencils and a brush. The supernote only has three  - fine liner, the pen (pressure sensitive), and the marker. The remarkable brushes all differ in the types of marks that they create and I have not yet found an absolute favourite but the brush seems very versatile lots of variation between thick and thin strokes and the biro mimics it’s real life counterpart rather well. The pencil is ok and uses tilt for shading but for some reason you can only choose one colour (black). 

Due to the smaller selection on the supernote the choice is pretty easy the pen works the best for me due to the pressure sensitivity and mimics fairly well the results that I get when I am sketching with a biro, I usually use lighter (thinner) strokes for initial forms and then lay down harder (thicker) stroke for final forms this technique also works well here. I hope that supernote include more ‘pens’ soon. I would love a brush that lets you lay down thicker strokes to make full use of the pressure sensitivity. The stylus sensitivity and lag on both are very good, perhaps the remarkable edges it here, but the supernote is very very good too.

Colours (greys) - the remarkable includes only three shades for their ‘pens’ - black, mid grey and white - with the exception of the pencil which as mentioned is only available in black. There is also a highlighter which lays down a lighter grey which is handy. It is also worth mentioning that the highlighter is translucent rather than opaque so you can still see your artwork behind it and the colour gets darker as you lay down subsequent strokes (like a real world marker pen) The supernote includes four colours for each tool - black, dark grey, light grey and white, but doesn’t include a translucent highlighter.

Erasing - where the supernote definitely outshines the remarkable 2 is in its erasing capabilities which you wouldn’t think would be a big thing, but it kinda is. I find it very difficult to see the eraser line on the remarkable and you only see what you have erased when you finish your stroke, so you’re never quite sure what the result is going to be, there seems to be quite a bit of trial and error as to how much of the stroke is erased, which is annoying if you are trying to erase precisely for highlights etc. If you are just using one layer then you can ‘erase’ using a white colour for any of the pens, but if you want to put a shadow layer beneath your main artwork then it kinda messes everything up because you have white opaque ink on the layer above. Supernote on the other hand nails this, the eraser works the same as the brushes, it erases instantly so you can be very precise. Obviously in real life you don’t have multiple layers in your paper notebook but thought it was worth mentioning.

Screen refresh - the remarkable leaves quite noticeable ghosting behind on darker inked areas when you close the tool sub palettes, and I don’t think it’s possible to do a manual screen refresh, although switching a layer visibility off and on seems to do the trick. I haven’t encountered these issues on the supernote but if I did you can swipe up on the sidebar to refresh the screen which is nice.

Size and portability - the remarkable is about the same size as an A4 piece of paper. So the equivalent of an open a5 notepad which is what I usually have in front of me in front of my keyboard when I’m working, so it’s a nice size, to scribble down some sketches or client notes when at work. The supernote may be a little small to jot down a lot of notes or sketches and it is not currently possible to zoom in to the canvas, but is absolutely ideal to pop in your bag and do some al fresco doodling. Another thing to note is that the remarkable 2 has a landscape mode but the supernote doesn’t. So if you are drawing in landscape orientation the toolbar is rotated 90 degrees

Overall feel - I preordered my remarkable 2 and just got the vanilla options so standard pen and sleeve only. So that cost around USD399 plus shipping The supernote a6x was USD 369 plus shipping but the real kick in the pants was the 20% extra you pay on import taxes. So these two devices were practically the same price. 

But when you handle them the remarkable feels like a luxury item and the supernote feels like a fun friendly gadget. I wouldn’t think twice about throwing the supernote in my bag and whipping it out to do some urban sketching, but the remarkable 2 feels a lot more precious and feels like it would be a lot more conspicuous in public places

From a pure sketching point of view it’s difficult to choose between the two. The pen performance on both is equally as good. The sheer size and paper feel make the remarkable great for cracking out development sketches and making  longer form notes at home or the office. The only thing putting a dampener on the experience is the eraser functionality. The size of the supernote makes it very portable and great for urban sketching, single sketches, and shorter notes/lists.

I’m enjoying them both and not sure which will get most use but I have a feeling that I’ll take the supernote everywhere with me, and use the remarkable primarily at my desk or on the sofa.

In summary

Remarkable 2

===========

\+ feels like writing on paper

\+ Premium feeling/looking product

\+ Pen performance is great

\+ Landscape mode

Eraser isn’t very good

Some screen refresh artefacts

Maybe a little conspicuous for urban sketching

Supernote a6x

===========

\+ Great size for urban sketching

\+ Free folio cover and pen

\+ Pen performance is great

\+ More shades of grey to choose from

\+ Eraser works well

Feels like biro on rubber not paper

Fewer tool to choose from

No zoom

No landscape mode

Maybe too small for development sketches or extensive notes

Hope that helps any doodlers out there Thank you for bringing a so fair and so detailed comparison.

After I read it carefully, I will follow your article from the role of product participant. This is such a great review. Very detailed. I especially agree with you on the size of the A6x. I find myself bringing it everywhere with me because of its size. Great review!

Another point I notice about the Supernote. The bottom end of the pressure curve has no opacity pressure. Only size. So the stroke gets smaller, and then just stops at a certain pressure activation.

On Remarkable, a light touch with the pen has a slight opacity falloff, like a real pen. The pencil even more so. So you can get a lighter half-textured stroke.

But even the Remarkable pen pressure curve doesn’t go to zero. It snaps off at a certain pressure. So if you try and draw an extremely light line, it snaps on and off like a dashed line.

I’d love if both these tablets had a complete drop off to zero on the pressure curve. It would make drawing much better. But with Remarkable, it has a slight edge because it has a bit of opacity falloff too.

Both feel nice though, and I enjoy drawing and writing on both.

Also, sometimes I use the Remarkable stylus on the Supernote. The plastic nib glides very nicely over the rubbery surface! And the stylus is lighter than the Heart of Metal stylus, so it’s a bit easier on my wrist after a while.  Supernote was originally designed for note-taking, so we made HoM into the same shape and weight as a traditional pen.

But when it comes to art, the lighter the better. So we're going to make a special pencil for the artist. It can also be used in other situations. And compatible with all Supernote tablets. This pen will be the default accessory for A5 SLIM, but users can purchase it separately.

"I haven't ordered an A6X yet,  was really hoping for an A5X soon.  I was wondering it anyone is able to test the Trello app for functionality and if it doesn't work is life to put in s request for it. Hello, thank you for your information, we have recorded your request. Could you please describe your use case? I am an engineering consultant. I create buckets for each of my clients and then create cards for each project I'm working on. Inside the cards I add notes from calls, task lists, setup a timeline that gets added to a calendar, etc. Once a project is done I will move the card to Client-Archive bucket. I would suggest you look at getting a regular tablet, like an iPad with a paperly screen protector instead to get a paper-like feel. I don't think this device or other eInk devices can properly support that work flow.

If you want just a Kanban board I'd understand. You could definitely draw up a Kanban template. But a fully functional Trello is excessive for these types of devices. 

Additionally, Trello doesn't support handwriting, so you would be typing everything out anyways, which will be a way slower experience due to eInk. 

Take Onyx Boox for example. They just use fully open android so you can install anything you want. But the performance of the app won't be any good for it. Since they have no control over a third party-apps, nothing can be done other than wait for an upgraded model that can handle it.

"After updating to the most recent A5 software here are some of my thoughts about the changes made to the top menu bar for note taking.

Moving the page number display position in notes to the top menu bar to prevent accidental touches was a definite improvement for my daily workflow. However I feel that the user interface design of the top menu bar still needs a bit more refinement, as I have now lost easy access to a lot of my regularly used menu items such as share &amp; export, templates, and quick access.

I think too much unnecessary space is being taken up by the note/document title (50% or more of the screen width) and the page navigation. By reducing the size of the space and decreasing the font size of the text for the titles, I think at least 3 or 4 of the other more commonly used menu items can be restored to the primary top menu instead of being relegated to the secondary drop down menu list instead.

Curious to know others opinions on the new top menu redesign for the A5. Which menu items do you often use that are now part of the secondary menu options (ooo)? 

Is there any way to customise which menu items are more important for inclusion in the primary top menu by prioritising the items in the same way that tag menu items are ordered in the settings menu?

As always thanks for the regular updates and feedback on questions and issues posted by users. Malcsweb, have you tried to simply double tap anywhere on the screen to hide all menus?  This gives you full screen real a state for writing or document viewing. Thanks but the issue is not about trying to hide menus for writing/reading but suggesting to get rid of empty white space in the title and page navigation section of the NEW top menu to make room for more menu options that used to be there previously. Thank you for your thoughts, this is very helpful. What do you think about the user interaction design of the A6 X? We have piloted a new user interface on the A6 X. The top menu has been redesigned based on the frequency with which users access different menu items. We are still working on this interface and plan to unify the A5, A6 Agile and A6 X once it is complete. Thanks Supernote\_official. Haven't seen the A6X design in detail but from what you described I like the idea of top menu items based on frequency of use. Look forward to seeing this feature in future updates.

1. I have never used the Kindle app before and I don t quite understand it.

I also find out that you can buy kindle books for 3rd party shops. I am not interested in the market aspect of it, because there are not many books in my language on their platform, but is there a reason to choose the kindle library over the default Supernote library (the tablet's interface itself)?

2. I just found out about the titling feature of the tablet, but can I use it for PDF s text (lasso -&gt; transform into title)? If not, how could I insert titles that could be recognized by the tablet if we are talking about a PDF that I created? 

3. Because I didn t find a solution to the .2 question, I am using bookmarks. Can i change the ""title"" of the bookmark? Long press doesn t work.

4. I just saw that .word format is available (I don t know if it was available before) and that a lot of functions were implemented for it, especially the zoom function. I was quite sad that I can t zoom in my PDFs, but I found out about the trimming feature for the PDFs files. This is like a zoom, right? Does it have another function?

1. kindle app is used to read the ebooks only from kindle store. 

2. We support the handwriting title to make the note file structured and indexable. because many user's note increased to dozens of pages, they need a easy way locate the page quickly. We will not support this feature on PDF/DOC. Because PDF/DOC has own methods such as cross-reference, you can jump to the page from the cross-reference.

"Just following up with a question I saw someone else had. A major use case for me to buy into an e-ink note taking device is to be able to skip a step when taking notes. The conversion of my handwritten notes to text that I can eventually turn into more coherent documents. Is handwriting to text in the pipeline for implementation? It's a fashion. But according to our test, handwriting recognition will limit the fun and freedom of notes, and even slow down the writing speed (in order to ensure the recognition rate). So we will support this feature, but the priority is not high. And handwriting recognition will first be applied in some partial features, such as keyword recognition, and the text insertion in the doc revision function that will be released in the next update. The function of ""entire handwriting recognition and import into DOC/TXT"" will be implemented at the end.

This is not a technical problem, but a difference in product concepts. That's good to know it is something that can be implemented. Thank you for actually responding, even if I am disappointed in the answer.

But wouldn't that improve the functionality and fun of a note taking device? I don't think it has to be done simultaneously, but if I'm using the supernote  to take notes during an interview, a meeting, or a lecture, which seems like a pretty common use-case, it would so helpful to be able to export my handwritten notes afterwards into a text document. I don't think it has to be live. It could even be something you schedule to do when the device isn't being used. It would add a practical element to something that is fun! 

For example. As part of an ideation process, I could be brainstorming something on my device, have it exported to an md, docx, or txt file, share with a colleague for feedback, and then I could review/annotate it back on my device. It would just eliminate a step of doing a manual conversion!

If it isn't a technical problem, you could implement it in a way that fits with your intentions for the devices. But if Nova and other note-taking eink/tablet can do it, its a bit unfortunate this one chooses not to. Especially when your devices seem to offer such good features in other ways! It seems like the devices are so close to what I want, and I may still buy one, but not having this available in the foreseeable future is a reason not to jump in, yet.

Either way, thanks again for replying and being transparent, even if I don't agree. Until I can justify a device, I wish the team continued success! If you output TXT/DOC in a calm environment, you will find the keyboard is the most efficient.  If you take notes in interviews or meetings, you will find that your writing needs to keep up with other people's speeches, which leads to scribbling.  Some sketches are even mixed in to make the description more intuitive.  These all increase the difficulty of identification.  If you have really used similar software, you will find that the effect may not be as good as you think.  We are not opposed to full text recognition.  We just tend to accumulate some assistive technology and then do this.  For example, how to distinguish between sketches and characters. Because once we start to do this, we must ensure that it is really effective, not just a marketing video in an ideal state. Yes indeed a keyboard would be more efficient, but for many reasons, not always viable. Hence a note-taking device can fill the need. It's good point that hand notes tend to also include sketches or special characters, like those in mathematical equations or flow charts or cluster maps. It is reassuring that it seems that there is a focus on delivering a clever bit of software as the goal. However, you did say earlier that it wasn't technically difficult. So now I'm confused.

Either way, it seems this functionality will be added, perhaps more in the future, but when it does, I think your software and products will become a lot more attractive to people like me, or academics, analysts, jotters, or creatives. The original point of my question was whether it was in the roadmap of functionality. I'm glad to see it is, disappointed it isn't as much of a priority, so now I'm hoping that when it does become a feature, that it was worth the wait",Handwriting to text,title prediction
"Hello guys! I'm wondering if A6X can handle pdfs (scanned books) well. I'm a bit worried about the screen size. I heard there's crop function but is that enough to read small texts?

How's your experience?

(p.s. eagerly waiting for the A5X) I am reading now on some material that I wrote in Times New Roman 12, double spaced, and with the crop function it s good. It was readable even without the crop function (I discovered it later).

The only part that I don t like about the crop function is the fact that it takes the ""note space"" away, but I believe you can ""\[ \]"" and make notes inside that - look into the user manual for this. 0:46 - PDF articles.

"It would be wonderful to be able to borrow free ebooks from my public library right from A5. I know other linux based e-reader devices can do this, e.g. Kobo.  I wonder if other A5 users would like this feature?  And....Is there any chance that Ratta engineers can integrate Overdrive or Libby into the A5 platform. OverDrive seems only support  ios/android. So you may get other resource, such as gutenberg project.  [https://www.gutenberg.org/](https://www.gutenberg.org/)  You may download the ebooks from the website and than transfer to your A5. Thank you hex2asc.  I appreciate your prompt reply.  I will try this.  

But, please allow me to ask another question.  I am not a programmer, so my knowledge is very limited in this area.  And I probably don’t know that I don’t know.   Nevertheless, when I was researching e-ink tablets, I selected the A5 because of the stability of Linux OS, which runs my wonderful A5.  I understand that Kobo e-readers also run on Linux.  How can they incorporate Overdrive, and not the A5 if hey are both on the same platform?  Is it because e-readers are fundamentally different from e-ink tablets? You like to ask why, which makes me have to check the usage of OverDrive.

I found that Kobo has developed an interface specifically for OverDrive, so Kobo can directly connect to OverDrive to browse and read eBooks. But for other eReaders, there will be some complexity, Users need to install the software ADE (Adobe Digital Editions) on PC/Mac . We can to vist the OverDrive website by PC browser, and then download the eBook, and then transfer the book to the e-reader.

We have not tried to connect to ADE,  we will learn more and try. I am grateful that you looked into it and even considering the request.  Best wishes.",Feature request: Overdrive on the the Linux A5 platform.,title prediction
"Is A6X more abrasive than Oynx on the pen? If I use the same pen (Lamy Al Star) on both of them, will the nib wear be the same? I am not sure about the nib wear, but i believe the nib you would use on both devices are different. Due to the surface coating on the A6X, the nib is harder compare to the nib you would use for Onyx.  


So if you do reuse a pen between the two devices, you would have to swap nibs before using. Thanks for the answer. Is it possible just to buy the nib for A6X from somewhere? Supernote devices have a built in screen protector that is much more pliable than Onyx (or any other e ink device).  The pen that comes with Supernote devices has a ceramic tip that never needs to be replaced.  It can only be used with Supernote devices - if you use it on any other type of device it will scratch the surface.

You can also get an upgraded package from Supernote that includes a Lamy Al Star EMR.  The nib on that is plastic and will need to be replaced.  Because the Supernote screen is more pliable than other devices, it's possible that nibs will last longer when used on that device versus other ones.

I purchased the A6X with the stock pen (ceramic nib) and it works great.  I also have a Lamy - but I use reMarkable nibs in it.  The stock Lamy nib on the Supernote felt too slippery.  The reMarkable nibs work great and have a better writing feel in my opinion.

I also have the Noris Digital Jumbo, and absolutely love the writing feel of that on the A6X.  I usually switch between the Noris and Lamy because I love both of them.

Based on a recent video from Voja ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgj5Y7NHY74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgj5Y7NHY74)) about the best pen and nib combinations for e ink devices, I have ordered the Samsung Tab S6 Lite pen and  HP ZBOOK X2 nibs.  Can't wait for those to come in.  On a side note, I also can't wait to order an A5X :D I had an Onyx Boox Max 3 and sent it back. Now I have a Supernote A6X. The A6X is far better than the Max 3 for the writing feel with the Lamy pen (with lamy standard nibs). The Supernote Pen is better than the Boox pen too.

"I use the Scribd app for ebooks and audiobooks. It is a service that is dying for an ereader but alas there isn't one. A partnership between Scribd and Supernote would be innovative! Copy that. Partnerships are both good and bad. How many devices do we  buy with preloaded applications we never wanted and can never get rid of? 

Is okay to offer it, but also allow the customer to delete it. The last thing Supernote needs is a application to Scribd that can never be removed by the customer.

Example, I dislike Facebook and never use it. But I can't uninstall it from my Samsung Note 9. I can turn it off, but it's always there. Very good points, I totally agree. I agree. I like the Kindle app on Supernote A6X - it works great on the e-ink screen and provides an option to read purchased books on an already excellent note taking device.

Having Scribd would provide a 'Netflix for books' like option to supplement Kindle's traditional book buying option and, for me, would complete the e-ink device experience.

I agree with another poster that too many apps would be cumbersome and detract from Supernote's streamlined user experience. If someone wants unlimited flexibility to download apps, Likebook and Onyx are options. I'm happy they picked Kindle and stuck with it instead of adding Kobo and Play Books and all the other alternatives. (I'd similarly be fine if they had picked a different store front - too many choices weigh down the user interface. Better to have one and stick with it.)

"Would it be possible to have a tools menu accessible in full screen mode? I like full screen for writing, but it is annoying to have to exit full screen to pull up the tool bar. Yes, a floating tool bar/bubble is comming in near update. Any chance of getting the A5 functionality of double tapping to go in and out of full screen? In the early design, we used a lot of hidden interactive functions. For example, double-click to enter/exit the full screen. Swipe from the side to the center of the screen to call the writing toolbar. Long press the file name to enter file delete/move/copy operations, etc. These designs make the interface more concise, but also cause some side effects. Most users will not read the user manual carefully (of course I do too), and they will complain if they don't know what to do. So in the later design, we try to avoid hiding functions, but it may be overkill.

" I know the Ratta team has a lot on their plates but hopefully this is something that can  be addressed in future software updates. I think both the rM and Supernote look as unclean as they do because of how note-taking on the devices themselves is the main selling point, and so to the creators of these eNote devices, export comes after that. Not saying that the exports should not look crisp, but it bears repeating what the primary intention of each device is to help understand where these young products stand. As for whether or not they're dealbreakers is up to the consumer.

In addition, Onyx Boox products tend to be somewhere in-between eNote and a full-blown eInk Android device, which is why they have the best of both worlds for software.

"After searching high and low, did you know, not a single note taking device or application offers hand recognition spelling checking. Not a single one.

If the device or application can do OCR for hand writing, then it could also spell check too. Normally OCR keeps some index of the words written to search against. That index could also be scanned against a dictionary. If the word is not found in the dictionary, the device or application could highlight or tag the word as misspelled. It's up to the developers of the tool offers spelling options or corrections.

I've put the same challenge to Goodnotes application team for the iPad. As I said, no one offers this feature yet. 

So depending if Supernote or Goodnotes implements first, then that's what I'm going with. My needs are simple, OCR for text search and spell checking. I posted before I finished. For OCR the possibilities really multiply. With standard text you can offer translation services.

Also, some people love writing notes, but they don't like their handwriting. So if you introduced OCR with font replacement, you can help those folks make beautiful notes. Write a word, and OCR picks up the word, and then replaces the word with nice font

Ratta might think of selling add-ons too. So everything I mentioned could be an additional extra folks could buy /unlock. No different that Goodnotes / Notability or other note taking apps.

If the difference between having full OCR with search and spelling check is extra $40, then that is worth it to me.

I hate subscriptions though. Have you checked out MyScript Nebo? I use it for long form writing (just straight up writing text, no drawings). It's on android and iOS and can convert your handwriting to text as you write. Just double-tap to convert. And it's easy to edit the text that's already been converted. Your handwriting style does not get saved. 

It can then export the text to different formats or other apps. I like to use it with Day One which is awesome for journaling. 

Doing long form writing on the Supernote feels like a lot of handwritten text that I have to review and type out if I want to make any good use of it. We have 3 goals

1 Make the note orgnized by original handwriting titles that can help user locate the page quickly. like ""table of contents"" of MS DocX.  Without any recognition. This is more free, you can set anything as titile, words, symbols,etc...

2 Can modify the DocX by handwriting. 

3 Can recogination entie page of handwring smartly(Able to distinguish between text and sketches) and output to Text/MarkDown/DocX.

"I was wondering if Supernote has any plans to support RemNote in X series (as RemNote is available as an android app) (see \[1\] below for further details on RemNote).

I think it would be quite useful to have an advanced note-management app (like RemNote, Obsidian, Roam research, Insight, etc) available in supernote directly; among these, RemNote is free and has an android app (btw I'm not affiliated with RemNote or anything, I just find it extremely efficient. See \[2\] for my use case).

I'm not sure whether this is a niche use case or whether there are a lot of supernote esers who would use this if it was available, so I'd appreciate if the community chimes in. Also, I'm tagging u/hex2asc : I'd appreciate if the Chief Chat Officer informs us to if there is any such plan :)  
\------

\[1\] For those who do not know, RemNote is a ""note-taking"" platform/app. It uses science-backed methods to ensure efficient learning (such as spaced-repetition, bi-directional linking, flashcards, etc).   Please see [https://www.remnote.io](https://www.remnote.io) for further details. There are several such platforms (RemNote in my opinion is most balakned, and is also free), for a nice comparison see these youtube videos [https://youtu.be/M2U61vHfQSQ](https://youtu.be/M2U61vHfQSQ) , [https://youtu.be/opSENgc45Sw](https://youtu.be/opSENgc45Sw) .

\[2\] I'm a PhD student in physics, and I use RemNote regularly to take both my academic notes and my daily scribbles . I  do not own a supernote right now, but I'll be buying a5x ---actually I would buy it right now while it is discounted but unfortunately I'm currently not in US and will not be back till the end of next month. I plan to use supernote to read papers (mostly arxiv stuff). I would definitely use this if it were available. I am not sure how feasible it would be though without the addition of an external keyboard. Part of the beauty of Remnote is how quickly one can enter and arrange data with keyboard shortcuts. But maybe I'm just too used to using it on my laptop to envision a new implementation.

Now, if only there were a way to have all of Remnote's features in a handwriting app then I would be in pure bliss. 🤗 I have to admin that I don't know RemNote or similar types of tools.  
My question here is how much RemNote needs web connection and ""intelligence"" from other places to organize/restructure information.

I think one of the main positive features of Supernote is that is focused on note taking, it can be used offline and you can choose when you need to go online or USB-connect to transfer/synchronise your stuff.  
To be too much dependent on external engines or tools (if this is something RemNOte requires) is not something I see as a positive path for Supernote, but of course this is a personal and quite limited point of view from myself :-) The poor CCO does not know much.

"Hi, I see with pleasure that Supernote is working hard to support editing functionalities for digital formats (i.e. Word .docx).

I have to admit that I'm not using them a lot now, but I'd like to ask here why the .docx format and if Supernote is planning to have a more general and standard approach to this.

Word is a proprietary tool and .docx is a not-so-great standard for text document (I don't use MSOffice and I use the standard .odt format, supported by LibreOffice, OpenOffice... for text documents).

What I'm thinking is whether simpler plain text formats could be supported as a more standard and interoperable basis to transform digital notes.  
I think that simple .txt files would be the first step, but an open and widely implemented and supported structured text format as Markdown ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)) would be an ideal solution.

I can see (dreaming) simple signs (short line or asterisks) for writing bullet points or identifying headers in the notes or ways to reference other notes (internal links). You already have some functions transforming manual input into structured commands (e.g. the square brackets or the stars for notes, the insert or flip command in the Word files) so it seems to me a natural evolution for more advanced functions.

I think that having a plain text format like Markdown supported could allow to have multiple types of export from it (.docx, .odt, .rst, simple .txt) and it can be well connected also with (future implementations of?) text recognition and transformation from manual notes to structured text.

Anyway, this is just food for thought... :-)

Ale I would personally love that feature! I do remember reading on this reddit that Mzrkdown support is planned. Text and MarkDown will be support. It’s in plan.

I find them both very comfortable to hold. The Lamy might be better for controlling the pen when trying to do precise work and it's lighter than the Heart of Metal. However, it probably comes down to personal preference. If you have access to a regular Lamy pen, the experience will be similar if you want to test it against a typical metal executive type pen that the Heart of Metal emulates.

The ceramic nib on the new Heart of Metal pens ensures that you won't have to worry about replacing nibs as they wear out. 

Personally, I like them both and alternate between them. The Lamy will also work on other EMR enabled screens like some Chromebooks and tablets. The ceramic nib on the Heart of Metal is hard so shouldn't be used with a device other than the supernote.

If you do a fair bit of drawing, then the Lamy might be the better pick. If you mostly take notes, I think that the Heart of Metal has the overall edge. I watched your guide and thought it was very good. I've watched many of your in-depth reviews and rely on them for choosing e-ink devices.

I would comment that I was surprised at the lower rating for Precision that you gave the Lamy (7/10) - not a bad rating - but in my experience, I found its precision to be very good and more comparable to the top of the group.

I was also surprised at the higher rating for the Samsung. It's a better pen than the standard Boox, but I didn't see it as anything special - too thin for my taste, round unlike the Staedler, and I didn't like the feel of the soft nib at all.

Otherwise, I agree with your ratings. 

Thanks for the guide! Thank you! You've been very helpful!",Difference between AL-star EMR and the other styluses,title prediction
"Hello all
I just figured out some of the basic yet powerful features needed on the the Supernote devices.

The pdf experience on the supernote is not bad, but some of  functionalities on it would make it great for any kind of document format...

1. Landscape mode for pdf documents.
2. Crop Features including the article mode support 
3. Gesture for bringing up the table of contents.
4. Insert clipart / image while taking notes.
5. Pinch to zoom in and out the content.

These features would make even the smaller A6x fully functional.

2. I will forward it to PM.
3. In kindle device, we can tap the top area to call the TOC. But in Supernote, we must filter the tap when writing. So can we call the TOC from sidebar?
4. In plan, but not start
5. Is developing. Awesome...
Thank you for the kind response
Really love the device and the writing feel on it
But yeah some times I feel adding functionalities would make the device even more better...

Looks like a lot of new features are on the map and really looking forward to see them on my A6X.

Reg.2 I mean TOC while reading pdf textbooks and not on the notes app.
And yeah if it is possible to call the TOC through the sidebar it would be handy and neat.
I have some ideas but not sure if it is possible to implement them on the device.
1. In a document -&gt; In the full screen mode (I mean *only when double tapped on a document to get rid of all the UI elements) - the sidebar when swiped up  instead of showing the regular app navigation menus it would be great if it shows TOC and as uasual manual refresh when swiped down. 
On exit (I mean again double tap) brings everything to the normal way as usual as it is at the moment...
(OR)
Atleast an option to manually set what the swipe up side bar does in which TOC is an option.

2. Two finger swipe on screen from left to right to bring up the TOC in a box covering half the screen is also an option...",Manditory Functionalities needed on the Supernote devices,title prediction
"I really like how responsive and supportive the Supernote team is, especially on Reddit. It's great to see they consider the user experience and feedback. A little while ago someone posted something and a rep from the team made a comment like 'we hadn't thought of that, it's an interesting idea'. I think this type of feedback system is great!

However, I feel a lot of people post on this sub with a kind of 'all or nothing' slant - like if 'Supernote doesn't do X, then I'm not buying!' It""s fine, it's a forum, it's up to you to make your line in the sand somewhere. But, why are some people writing so absolutely? I think if we have feedback or suggestions, it would probably be most effective written with examples or justification or use-case scenarios. I know I'd be more inclined to listen to well-explained ideas rather than ultimatums. 

Alas, just some boxing day venting. Cheers y'all You should see r/remarkabletablet if you think this is bad... Not comparable.
Remarkable support does not respond, it is normal that ppl go absolute in that case. Supernote read every single line and answers.
The point is not ""it is bad"", the point is ""it has no sense to write with this tone."", as far as I understand. Yeah, in general I agree. A lot of people are kinda taking the teams responsiveness for granted.

Here are just a few examples:  

* ""I've put the same challenge to Goodnotes application team..."" ""My needs are simple""
* ""Mandatory functionalities needed""
* ""Why are you not supporting""

As much as I love the teams responsiveness, I do feel some people have been quite harsh in their wording when making requests.

Personally I'd rather the team improve what they already have, before adding more work to their plate and bloating the system. I've always seen Supernote to be a minimalist alternative to other devices simply for ""note-taking"".

I guess some people want stuff with all the bells &amp; whistles like:

* E-reader with pdfs, news, books, and probably even websites.
* E-writer with every single text format.

Which is pretty much the Onyx Boox. Which is not minimalist or lightweight. I'd personally rather a tool that does one job, and one job well. To jump off of the last sentence:

As useful as the kindle update is, I'm very excited for the improvements they're making with their native writing software (e.g. pencil brush and Word editing). They're consistently refining the ""mobile office"" idea with each update, and I'm glad to see that they take the time to put in additional stuff but only as secondary or supportive of the ""mobile office"" theme. Hopefully in the next update or the one after it, they have some improvements for the native pdf reader for markup and export.

"I had my A6x for a few months now, but today was the first time I had to transfer some files to it from my phone.  I tried to pair it, but I keep getting nowhere.  I tried initiating pairing from the phone and A6x with same results.

Basically the two devices see each other, both pop up a pin screen and both have a pair button.  When I click pair button on A6x a keyboard pops up, which I assume is to enter the pin.  When I enter the pin it kicks me back out of the bluetooth settings screen. The two appear to be briefly connected, but then connection is lost.  Any clue what's going on.

If it matters I have a Google Pixel 4 that works fine with my other bluetooth devices. We think that the Bluetooth transmission rate is low, so we did not use it to transfer files. And only use it to support Bluetooth keyboards and Bluetooth speakers. It will failed to connect to other devices. But we should give tips for other connections that are not supported. Clear information should be given instead of letting users guess what happened. This is our mistake. We will fix it as soon as possible.

If you transfer files from a mobile phone, it is recommended to use cloud synchronization. You can use Supernote Cloud or Dropbox. You can also use Wifi-Direct to transmit directly (it needs to be on the same WIFI network, sometimes it is not stable). Both of these methods require you to install the Supernote Parter App or Dropbox App on your phone. Is there any update on the super note app not functioning for the last few months?

1) How long does it take to ship? I live in California.

2) Is there a desktop app? If so, can I create a note in the desktop app or is it simply importing/exporting? The reason I ask is because my work prevents me from using cloud services due to security reasons. I was hoping I could import screenshots from my work computer and place it in a note on the A6X via USB.

3) How frequent are you guys recharging your device?

TIA!! Hello.

1. About the ship... It took me 7 days aprox to come to Spain. But I paid €150 of taxes...
2. Nope. Only the Browser version of supernote's app. But you can configure dropbox. The only problem is you cannot see notes in dropbox. You must export first to PDF or JPG from your A6X.
3. It depends, it can last 1 week if you use it for hours. For me is about 2 - 3 weeks of light use because I'm not that busy right now.

Anytime! 1) West Coast here. Bought it on Christmas, got shipped on the 28th, and received it on the 31st. So 3 or 6 days, depending on how you measure it.

3) I charged it once in the time I've had it, though it's about to need another one. 2. I find even though I sync to Dropbox, I don’t review my notes on devices other than the Supernote itself.

"Hi! A very happy user of A6X here. I had a feature request. 

Currently the name of a new note is basically the timestamp without spaces. I do want dates as the name of the notes, but I would like the option to make it more readable so I don't have to change it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason and explanation:

* I find using the keyboard and renaming a notes doc every time I create one tedious, and the current timestamp one is not as readable
* Mostly I end up just adding spaces/dashes to make it more like yyyy-MM-dd-timstamp format, so would be great if say the device could give option what the default name is. 
   * Some options could be
      * yyyy-MM-dd &lt;day of week&gt; i.e. 2021-01-05 Tuesday
      * yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss i.e. 2021-01-05 12:00:00
      * yyyy MMM dd i.e. 2021 Jan 05
      * and many more
   * In case of duplicates, the notes can always append (count) to differentiate. Eg: ""2021-01-05 (1)"" if another file with the same name exists After seeing your suggestion, I immediately understood why I always thought the default file name was strange before.

"Hey... Just ordered A5X and have a few questions.

I have a sizeable Zotero library 6000+ pdfs that I currently sync to my BOOX via Google drive and an app (autosync). This works pretty well as Zotero automatically names the pdf files with author-year-title, and search is quick enough on BOOX to bring up the thing I need in a couple of seconds. I can then annotate and save, the annotated version gets automatically synced back to my laptop.

What I want to know is - does dropbox sync on Supernote automatically keep in sync? How well will Supernote handle that many PDFs in terms of search speed? And, will annotations be backed up straight to Dropbox/laptop?

Cheers! How are you using Zotero as a pdf library? :O Annotations are backed up to drop box as a separate .mark file. So you’ll have the original unedited .pdf, plus a .mark with annotations. 

You have to export or use the supernote companion app if you want new pdfs that have the annotations integrated. Zotero works really well to organise pdfs - you can drag/drop a pdf onto the main window and it will usually find the metadata for it (better than other reference managers I've used). The trick for getting pdfs easily available on mobile is to use the extension 'zotfile' which will rename the pdf and move it from Zotero's own labyrinth directory structure into one big directory that you can sync with Google Drive/Dropbox. Also, the browser addon for Zotero is great for taking html snapshots of webpages - these come out really well on Boox devices (I don't know about other ereaders) as text-resizable books.

The annoyance on Boox (as with Android tablets/phones) is there is no way to push changes to the Google drive folder to the device, so you have to use a third party app that you manually sync or set it to look at time intervals. This works, but just not very efficient.

There is an android app - zoo for zotero - that's really well made and can link to the synced folder to open pdf attachments. The problem is that when you have a lot of pdfs it can be very slow to open the pdf. Maybe down the line a version for Supernote could be great. Ah, thanks for the info. That should work fine for my needs. In some ways it is better to keep the version in my Zotero library clean from my scribbles anyway and it is good to have a separate place for marked up versions to know what's been read, maybe.","Zotero, Dropbox sync and search capabilities A5X",title prediction

an Idea I had, since kindle is its own aplication would be adding a small memo pad on the top pull down menu, that way taking quick notes from kindle (or any future apps might be possible) within the app. I dont know how feasible it is to make the app and note function work at the same time.

another thing I was thinking which I dont know if it is already a setting or not since I could not find it, is displaying the residence or contact info at the lock screen, in the case the tablet gets lost.

currently If I loose my device, whoever finds it would need to unlock it, go to the menu, find account information and then contact me.

"Hi Supernoters, I have a question.  

I am on the A5.  I have a note page that I use to document and track my billable hours for consulting services.  For ease of documentation of my consulting hours, I linked this page under [Quick access].  That note file now is now 37 pages long, and grows weekly.  Every time I go to [Quick access] and open this this note file, it opens by default to the first page.  I then have to jump to the last page to add new hours.  Is there a way to have Supernote to open (by default) the last page that was opened?  Has someone found a workaround?  If not, then can the last paged opened in a note page be the default when accessing a note file from [Quick access]?

Thanks Tats a neat idea. Could definitely see how that is useful. On drawboard there is a little symbol that lets you jump back to the start of the previous  'timestamp' like when you first started a chapter or something. It would be cool to have Great suggestion.

"Hello Supernote,

I’ve pre-ordered the 5x and am excited to start using it!  I’ve been watching videos on it and noticed you changed the ‘create’ button so that instead of instantly creating a new note, you now have to choose whether you want to add a note or a Word document. 

I think many of us will rarely (if ever) create a Word document as we have purchased this device primarily for making hand written notes. 

Can you please either move the Word document creation to another location, or only show that option after a long tap-and-hold, etc. so that a regular tap on the ‘plus’ icon will simply create a note?

I plan to create dozens of notes per day so this would make the experience much more pleasant. 

Thanks for considering. Agreed Your suggestion make sense. We will change it soon.

Thank you very much. Thanks very much! Agreed too!! I dont really need the word document creation function so readily. Perhaps place that option in the document folder? Thanks so much to the supernote team! I feel theyve been so innovative :)",Return to single-tap note creation,title prediction
"Hi everyone,

1.  I saw something posted here a while ago about choosing a server, but I can no longer find it.  I created my account on the Supernote A5x and enabled sync.  Upon logging into the cloud in my browser I accidentally clicked the China location, not realizing I couldnt switch afterwards.  Is there any way to switch server location after the fact?  Is there an option on the physical device I may not be seeing?

2.  I was testing things out, creating notes and playing around with the features.  I hit the sync button to upload what I have, went to the server website, and all I can see are the folders Ive created.  No notes show up at all, only the one screenshot I took.  Any information on this?

3.  Is there an export/save as pdf option yet?  I saw the post from a while back that it was coming but I havent seen any updates on it so far.

Thanks in advance for any help! Re. 1, paging /u/hex2asc.

For 2, have you actually selected the folders you want to sync? It doesn't default to syncing anything and might just be showing you a skeleton directory structure.

For 3, hit the 3 dots -&gt; Export -&gt; PDF, or do you mean proper vector export? For 2.  How do I select which folders to sync?  Long press, check them, then hit sync from the drop down?

3.  I figured that one out, just what I needed it to do.  Edited my original post.

Thank you for your help! So you need to go back into settings, go into sync, and click the right arrow to choose folders. You can choose a folder by checking it or enter the folder by tapping it (say you only want to sync a subdirectory -- as an example, I sync a directory called Personal but not Work).

If the folder chooser doesn't show up, it's a software glitch -- rebooting (in the settings too) will fix it. I see the arrow, and all of my folders are checked off",Questions about syncing and other things.,title prediction

"Hey, so I'm upgrading my trusty old kindle keyboard ereader and I really really like the look of the supernote devices. They just look much nicer than boox in my opinion. I love the aesthetic, the nicer pens, the nicer cases etc.

One of the huge reasons to upgrade my old kindle is to get a Glow light. At the moment I use a clip on light that is a faff. I know supernote devices currently don't have lights but will they in the future? Is it worth me waiting to see if they get one?

My second question is will super note support apps/apks so I can borrow books from my local library? Here in the UK most library's use BorrowBox which has an Android app. The second most popular library app is Libby. Will Supernote make these two apps available?

Thanks Very much doubt they'll ever have a light, it requires more space between the pen and the screen which makes writing feel funny. I think it's unlikely you'll see such niche apps supported but I don't know their full plans with regards to app support. It kinda seems like you're looking for a different device than what supernote is trying to be, the target is note taking as a top priority. Yeah fair enough, thanks for the feedback. I'm also an app developer and would love to make some eink friendly apps so I guess the boox or likebook devices are the ones for me. I just thought the supernote looked so much nicer! I saw an old comment of a user that suggested a folio with an integrated light. That would be a perfect solution in my opinion.
You have it if you want to, don't have it if you don't want. While waiting for mine to arrive I've been thinking about some of the things I'd like to see added (like Libby/Overdrive)... but I'm also thinking about how difficult the Ratta situation is.

"From what I have understood there is no charger shipped with the device.  
I wanted to ask the following  
a)Does the supernote support fast chargers  
b)What type of chargers does Ratta recommend for the supernote? I mean how many Amphere Here's a comment from hex2asc on A6X charge:
&gt; A6X support USBPD (the main fast charge standard). It's a negotiation protocol. When plugged, the charger will ask A6X, ""how much current you want?"", and A6X always answer,""1.5A is enough"". So the charger will start supply current limited by the agreement. You need not worry about too much current would damage the device. Typically A6X will get full charged in 2 hours by a 7.5W (or more powerful) PD charger.
&gt;
&gt; If you want to use a fast charger, please make sure it's PD type.
&gt; 
&gt; It's also ok if you use a computer USB port for charge, it will take more time than PD charger, at about 3-6 hours. Because of computer USB port usually limit the current supply at 0.5A-1A level.

"Hi,  


I have been deliberating between the Remarkable 2 and Supernote A6x for a while.

I was just about to order the A6x but I saw a lot of people having battery issues. The Remarkable lacks a lot of features against the A6x but the battery is way more superior, it seems.  This is disappointing since rm2 has a 3000 mAh battery vs A6x is smaller with a 2900 mAh battery.

  
However, there have been some latest software updates (one of the 12 days ago) on the A6x and the release notes contains some changes to battery performance. What is the exact status about battery issues right now? If battery is a big deal for me, should I go for rm2 instead? I own both . I cannot recommend the rm2 honestly . Get the a6x or the a5x , stylus is better , more accurate ( never have misalignment issues like I do on the rm2)( no expensive nib replacements ) . Supernote developers are doing fixes and implementing useful and important  features ( have already experienced a few myself ) , where as all the updates on rm2 have been trivial and haven’t really added to the ( already barebones) utility.  I use my a6x many times throughout the day I maybe charge it ever 2 days . The great thing is I charge it with a USB c charger and it charges very quickly , battery is of no concern here coming from someone who’s used it for more than a month now .  The biggest pain point with the rm2 is that you cannot simply plug it in and quickly drag and drop files . You have to use their apps and cloud and other silly workarounds . With the supernote it is just drag and drop , updates instantly . They have also mentioned fixes to help battery further . I recommend supernote Rm2 is also more expensive.

Charging once in two days is not so bad. But do you employ it for heavy use, like taking notes the entire day or something? Sometimes when I’m doing long drawing or long notes i charge every other day . When I’m just using it as a planner many days can go by . So, the weird battery bugs are probably fixed by now, but it still probably stands at somewhere like 6 hours of non-stop writing (from [MyDeepGuide](https://youtu.be/mB8fTVPH1cY?t=948)).

I personally think Supernote is superior simply because you don't need to pay multiple times for a new nib. Though Remarkable 2 and A6X are kind of a bad comparison since, A6X is much smaller. I've had the impression that both A5X and it's upcoming successor (intended to be released Q3 this year), will and are clearly much better than rM2.

Also from what I've heard, rM2 has terrible customer service.

Good question! I also have a rM2--ideally would be great to be able to continue a journal I started on rM2 over to SuperNote. Seems unlikely tho :( I did it by using PDF export.

"Just want to shout out that I got my first e-ink tablet - Supernote A5x! 

I've been thinking about getting one for more than a year, following the development of Sony and Remarkable, and after watching the review by Voja, decided to take a leap and got it.

Quite happy with the device so far, and am excited to find this community and that Supernote is actually seeking users' opinion here!

Happy writing! Agreed! Awesome device paired with amazing customer service and community! I just joined “the family” too, I love that everyone on here (including Ratta Supernote themselves) is so helpful! :) Me too - got mine yesterday and stayed up till 1am figuring out how to customise it and get my stuff on it. Love that Supernote is very active in interacting with the users! And it seems like they will have frequent upgrades.

"I got my A5X yesterday in the post and so far I am loving it!
I am having trouble syncing my Dropbox to the device though. I have connected to my account successfully, and Dropbox has registered that the supernote is connected. 
However when I go to select the folders I want to sync, it does not show my Dropbox folders, only the folders that are already on my device. I've tried rebooting/resetting like a previous post suggested but no luck. Am I missing a step somewhere?
Thanks in advance! I was playing with this last night, and discovered it would only sync folders that were put in the Supernote main folders. It looks like you can’t add folders to those main ones (which are documents, notes, mystyle etc.) To get the main supernote folders to sync you have to select them so they have a tick in the top left hand corner - then they appear in Dropbox) you can then move files into them.

"Morning Coach just posted a quick snapshot of 6 ways the Supernote A5X beats the reMarkable 2:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL3wJnqN2P0&amp;feature=youtu.be

I sent back the RM2 because it looked good but didn’t offer much functionality. Then I returned the Note Air had the opposite problem – bloated with apps and a complicated user interface that made work harder. 

Supernote A5X seems to solve both problems with refined apps built for purpose and a simple, streamlined interface to get things done without any headaches. I’d rather be working on a task than working out how to use the device. This video should be shown to everyone that loves remarkable 2 over other devices lol. Other than sketching, supernote can do everything remarkable can do, and BETTER Well... wait for his ""6 reasons to get Remarkable 2 over A5X"" video in a few days ;) Altho, as an owner of both, I am currently won over by the A5X (even tho I still really enjoy the ""feel"" of the rM2 device and writing when I pick it up and use it). The functionality of the A5X has won me over (love keywords), and not having to replace nibs! Since you have both devices, can you describe the writing experience of Supernote versus reMarkable? A lot of users have trouble describing writing on a Supernote. 

Also, which stylus do you have - the ceramic or the Lamy (I still have my Lamy which I loved using). Remarkable 2 has a ""scratchier"" free. Not in a bad way--in a good way. I guess the best analogy I've heard is: it feels like using a pencil on paper laying on a table or clipboard. It's feels like a harder surface, but again--not in a bad way. Frankly, I still feel like I might prefer it to the A5X feel--even tho the A5X feel is also very good. Yep, I know, maybe not the most helpful.

The A5X has a smoother/slicker feel... and it also depends upon which A5X pen you use. I have both the Heart of Metal and Lamy. The Lamy has a slight scratchier feel, because it's plastic. The HOM is very smooth (ceramic). In reality, the A5X and Remarkable are probably very similar in smoothness--but the Remarkable seems to have more friction/scratchiness due to the sound of its tip on its surface.

FWIW--even though I may enjoy the feel of the remarkable more, i like the sharpness of the A5X pens more. I feel like I can write cleaner/thinner lines on the A5X due to the different pen/surface (especially with the HOM).

As far as which A5X pen I prefer--I still don't know. When I switch to the Lamy, I think ""oohhhh yeah--I think this feels better"". But then I'll use that for awhile, and then switch back to the HOM, and think ""yep, I like the sharpness with this"". So, I guess--get them both if you can(!) I DO love the eraser button on the Lamy--extremely useful. And while I wish the design was a bit better (so I didnt have to find  and line up my finger with the erase button everytime I grab the Lamy), I still think the Lamy is great especially if you think you'll be erasing more than usual. The way I look at it--the Lamy is an eraser I bought that also has a built-in pen ;) And the HOM is for when I just want sharp lines and I'm not worried about making mistakes and/or needing to use the eraser much. The UI's erase function still works well with either one, so not a big deal--but the Lamy's eraser button is very convenient once you have it and get used to it.",Morning Coach lists 6 reasons why Supernote A5X beats reMarkable 2,title prediction
"Dull - but necessary question.  I'd like to use my supernote for both personal purposes and work and therefore do have some questions about how my data is used. There are quite a few users in here from Europe (where GDPR or UK GDPR is applicable).  I had a look at your privacy policy and note that it says that it's only applicable for mainland China.  There is also a statement which says, ""In principle, the personal information we collect and generate in China will be stored in China"" [https://supernote.com.cn/user/PrivacyPolicyEn.html](https://supernote.com.cn/user/PrivacyPolicyEn.html) However you will be processing data which is generated elsewhere and stored in your servers either in China or Amazon Japan.   Please can someone provide more transparency about what happens with our data.  It's worth looking at RM's privacy policy as it does at least contain more specific info about what happens to our data. I usually don t care about this stuff, my data being anyway sold in every part of the globe, but tag me when someone replies, because now I am curious as well. Well... if you're using this as a digital notebook, you're likely storing more than just basic identity info such as email or phone number (the typical data sold around the world). People may choose to store very sensitive information in their notes... if the data is not protected, that data could be exposed. Which is why I'm very leery of putting any sensitive data in my A5X until I have the ability to store in a different service such as Google Drive. Even then, I'm still not fully trusting enough to put sensitive data in this device :( Thank you for bringing this up - it's something very reasonable to ask. I have the same problem as you because I want to use these devices for work and some of the things I write or draw could eventually become IP. If the data gets in the wrong hands, it's pretty well known some Chinese companies can steal and not care about IP ownership laws.
I'm really encouraged by Ratta's responses on this subreddit so would be great to hear from them on this. This is very important!

There are two types of data that will transfer to the server

The first is cloud services

In order to comply with Chinese laws (all companies providing information services in China must set up servers in China. Apple is no exception). But this doen't matter with users outside of China. What we said,  ""In principle, the personal information we collect and generate in China will be stored in China"" is mainly for chinese users. Don't worry about that.

If you want to use Supernote cloud service, we strongly recommend  do not use a Chinese server. (Amazon Japanese server is now available, US server/EU server is coming soon). Otherwise, you can use Dropbox instead. I don’t need to confirm if you are not a Chinese user, because Chinese users cannot see this message (Reddit is blocked in China).

Anyway. The most thorough method, you can turn off the cloud service. Use USB data cable, U disk and other methods to transfer data with computer.

The second is the User Experience Project.

If you agree to participate in the User Experience Project, we will upload some logs. It is usually the performance info in some operation events, such as the time it takes to open the file, the data of battery consumption, and the related information when the fault occurs. We use these data to evaluate and improve performance. It will not be used for purposes not related to improving performance. We will list log types and uses in detail later and update on the website. You are right, We need transparency.

If we need more detailed information for special purposes, such as improving the rendering of handwriting. We will launch a special volunteer program, where participants can send samples of their non-privacy note files to our collection mailbox. We will not store such data in the log.

Anyway, you can refuse to participate in the User Experience Project to avoid uploading any information.

I want to say that your concerns are absolutely necessary.

I.e. when exporting a note as a pdf, it would be great if I could have supernote insert a margin around the note. 

This would be useful if one wished make notes on the exported note using something like Skim on the computer. It would also be useful if the notes are to be submitted to a marker, as the marker would have more space to write comments.

"Just wondering about a possible implementation of a way to rapidly switch between two apps - like ALT-TAB on a computer. At the moment if I want to switch between a note and a book I have to swipe the side bar, then tap on the thing I want. This is pretty good. 

But I just wonder if there could be an option in settings to remap an up-swipe from screen refresh to app-switch. This would make an make it a really quick way to move between two things. 

If this option was selected, the screen refresh function could be activated by an on-screen button in the toolbar. Similarly, if the user chose to keep swipe up to refresh, then the toolbar button could active the app switch.

Just a thought! Interested to hear what others think. I do also really like swipe up to refresh, but for me personally I think I would get more use from switching apps.

Also, the ability to wake the device with a swipe (up or down) would be a nice touch - I find myself trying to do this anyway! :) I think clicking the button to wake to sleep is enough for me, even on my Boox it’s the same thing.

As for the swipe up to switch apps, I like it how it is now (swipe up to refresh), I actually have the same gesture on my Boox. Given that the limited number of apps is visible on swipe down anyway, I find that enough to switch between apps/documents really quickly. I would like this as an option, too. Perhaps it could be an option for the swipe up, to change in settings? Much like the first iPad allowed the switch to be either screen lock or something else (was it mute?), depending on user preference. I hardly use the swipe up. I think it would be awesome to customize and have users choose what they want that action to be. Personally I would like it to open the last most recent note or file so I can quickly switch between two. This would be a neat addition.",Swipe up for rapid app switching (and wake from sleep),title prediction

"I have 6 custom templates... they appear in the device's MyStyle folder, but only 4 of the 6 appear in the Template-&gt;Customization selection screen. Also, there are 2 templates I initially added but then deleted. Everything looks fine on the SuperNote (Japanese) cloud server/website, as well. It's just the the template-&gt;Customization screen that is messed up (only shows some of the custom PNGs I added, and 2 that I deleted are still there).

Yes, I have rebooted--a couple times, and I have sync'd a few times. I also made sure the MyStyle folder was checkmarked in the sync settings.

So... help... More details... I've played with the filenames of the png/template files I uploaded. I made them shorter and removed periods from them. I now get 4 of the 6 templates in my Customization template pages, and the deleted ones are gone. So now, I'm missing 2 of the 6. Is there a reason it will only show the first row of 4 in there? A common issue is the use of special characters in filenames as you have already discovered by removing periods from your filenames. Although the Supernote manuals list various characters to avoid they fail to include underscores in their list ( \_ ) which is often the culprit for custom templates not showing up. No underscores. The files that appear in the Customization page have the same format as those not appearing. Only use letters, numbers and spaces in the fielnames.

"Hey guys, just discovered e-ink devices recently and been doing some research. Even though i love the idea behind it, and am very intrigued to get one, I'm still between the fences about whether i really need one. 

Therefore, I'd like to find out what you guys are really using it for and what made you buy one. After all they aren't cheap devices and i wanna make sure I'm not wasting money. I use it as a daily planner , brain dump, sketch book , notebook all in one place. Helps me to organise my thoughts and notes beyond what I could with a regular notebook. Plus I just much prefer handwriting then typing on computer in meetings etc, I can concentrate better and also be more free in structure which helps me. Finally, the A5X is just so nice to write on that I now actually write more and I’m less precious about pages too! I should add that I also love that it’s not a tablet per say, so less distractions, blue light and need to recharge often. Not to mention no glass! I also own iPad Pro with pencil, and i love using the ipad with pencil mainly for marking up pdfs and notes. I also use it for board games (i'm a big boardgamer), in which I'll track game status/characters/etc by using PDF game sheets in Notability (ipad note taking app), and marking 'em up. BUT... I got intrigued by e-ink note takers for the better non-glass feel and to get away from staring into a computer/lit display. With that said... I'm fairly new with a rM2 and A5X. The software is generations behind iPad... but the e-ink/non-glass experience makes it worth if. Will I be solely e-ink and no iPad for note taking? Not sure. But right now, ive been 100% A5X (after starting with rM2) for about 4 weeks. Also using it for tracking workouts (I maintain a daily workout journal), general daily notes... and the keyword feature on the A5X has won me over, as it allows my to label/tag journal spots for easy searching. Software is quirky/buggy (e.g. the cloud sync functionality), but I'm hopeful (based upon Ratta's strong customer involvement/dialog) these will be ironed out and improved. Before I ve bought the A6X, I wanted to write, but the thought that pages end filled me with dread, so I didn t write. It s a poor excuse, because I do not write even after I acquired an infinite amounf of digital pages.

If I had the money, I would have definitely gone with the iPad Pro, but I am glad I didn t. 

An e-ink tablet is the perfect substitute for a notepad and that s all it is to it.

What sold it to me was the infinite pen and the community that they ve build on reddit, the last being the most important. Now, thinking about it, whatever they would sell, I would buy.

Hi u/Hex2asc,

I’ve had my A5X a few days and I think it’s fantastic. Here is some initial feedback, requests and questions:

&amp;#x200B;

**Feature requests**

* Please can we have caps lock on the keyboard
* Please can we have a way to add accents to letters in the keyboard
* There should be the ability to change the date format (eg dd/mm/yy) from the default American format of month-day
* Should be able to send PNG attachments in email. Currently, sending attachments only works with PDF, while PNG attachments are ignored
* Please can we have indented lists in Word when using bullets?

**Questions**

* In word, is there some way to erase a handwritten mark or writing?   
If I make a mistake while adding handwritten text or marking up, there seems to be no way to delete it, other than double-tapping to convert it and then deleting it after conversion, which is really laborious. It would be great to have an eraser button.

**Other feedback/bugs**

* When switching from handwriting to typing in Word or when turning on repage view, any hand writing on the page is deleted without any warning or asking to convert it first. This is a serious issue and can cause a lot of lost work.
* Backspace connect does not work as described in the manual 
* You can't rename a Word doc when it’s open the way you can with a note. This feels inconsistent
* When renaming a doc or note from the files overview, the 'x' is too far to the right (this does not affect the function, it’s just is an aesthetic UI bug)
* Deleting a document in the cloud from the browser interface does not work. You get a confirmation, but the file stays in the folder, even after sync. The only way to delete it is from the A5X device itself, which then works across the device and the cloud after syncing.

Thank you in advance for your consideration and keep up the great work! Just a quick feedback on ""Please can we have caps lock on the keyboard"".

I can simply double click the ""Shift"" (big up arrow) key. I agree for the date, it is really confusing, it should adjust based on the timezone or let us define the way we want to appear ""Deleting a document in the cloud from the browser interface does not  work.

Awesome! Somehow none of the  reviews I have watched mention the hyperlink support. And I had a very very negative experience with the Remarkable's software making me cautious purchasing cool looking but expensive products.

Is the table of contents collapsible and respecting the hierarchy? I.e. is it easy to navigate a book with four chapters but hundreds of paragraphs in the TOC? Or everything is on the same level (making it difficult to find the chapters)? If the latter, is it on the timeline to fix it?

And is there an option to search for PDF metadata? I plan to have many pdfs on the device and I would like to search for authors/title/arxiv number (if the title is long, then it's not practical to use it as a file name) etc. This fantastic mate.

"All of the other e-ink devices are available on either Android or Linux platforms. Supernote is the only device that gives you a choice because its tablets are available with either operating system. Amazing.

I’d like to know what users see as the pros and the cons of both platforms. Do Supernote’s Linux products have a faster processing speed or better latency? Do the Android devices offer better functionality? 

Why do you think one is better than the other, based on your use case? I’d love to know what Ratta thinks as well and why they are committed to producing two versions of the A6 and A5. I went with the A5X because although I don't use Kindle it seems like the Android OS has more potential for additional functionality in future. It's been working great so far - it does slow down a lot when I'm drawing and using the copy/paste and resizing features heavily but honestly I don't really mind that as drawing really isn't the primary reason I got it. I also can't comment on whether the A5 is any better in this respect - maybe someone else could add something here?

I saw it said somewhere that although the battery capacity is greater on the A5X the android OS is more demanding and so the battery life is actually lower - again I don't have a point of comparison but I certainly haven't had any issues with battery life, keeps going for multiple days.

"I preordered the A6X and I've really enjoyed it as my first ereader and note taking device. However, there are basic navigation features that would make it much easier to use.

It's annoying to flip through tens of pages when navigating through documents and digests. There should be an an option to skip multiple pages, skip to the end, and enter a page number (similar to when navigating documents). Even better would be searching for files or folders in the current directory or skipping by alphabetic ordering (skip to where Hs or Vs begin like a contact book).

It would be nice to have a back button when navigating documents. So when I open a folder, I can go back to the same page in the document navigator rather than flipping through all the pages to get back to the same page.

Most if not all good epub readers automatically embed links to footnotes, so you don't need to flip to the references pages to find the footnote. It'd be really nice if I could tap on a footnote and have the footnote appear in a little window.

One should be able to annotate digests in the document viewer, rather than navigating to the digests app.

Each of these features would improve the ease of use a lot for me. In addition, having a overview that shows a grid of all pages like the remarkable would make it much easier to navigate visually when you don’t already know which page number you want You are in luck!! All of these options are available on your device already! Taping the ellipse in the toolbar brings up the menu which the overview option which brings up page thumbnails. u/official_marcoms. Taping on the page numbers opens up the ability to jump to any page you would like. Dragging down from the top of the screen allows you to search all directories by file name, keywords or stared pages. I highly recommend running through the user manual there are a lot of hidden tools and gestures built into different parts of the device and Ratta is always listening to its users for more feedback! I think I wasn't clear on the page skipping. I don't mean the pages in a document, I mean the pages when browsing through files and folders. It would be great if the same functionality to skip to a page in a document also worked when browsing a folder of documents. I sometimes reverse the sorting so I can at least flip through each page in the list of documents from the reverse of the alphabetic order.

I like the search function, this is ends up being the best way to go. Searching in the current directory is what I usually want, but this isn't so important.

I realized the last feature is in the user manual. I was tapping digests with the stylus, but I figured out that I need to tap it with my finger to annotate a digest.",Feature Request: Navigation and Usability,title prediction

"Random notes from today's waste management class on Vermicomposting. I really like taking notes by hand I find that I remember more of the content when I draw and doolie the ideas out. This is one of the many reasons I really enjoy my supernote. It has become part of my study pattern to go back, edit and clean up the doolies a bit. After class, I will take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour adding to the notes and doodles. The post by u/teicherus of the [possible colors values](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/lmo94r/possible_color_values_for_templates/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) on the SN have me excited about the potential of the current hard wear and to see what other tools are to come! 

Additionally, I enjoyed the use of the floating toolbar, however, I wish I could turn it horizontal again.  I used to keep it docked to left hands side of notes and it was rarely in my way (right-handed). I very much like the ability to collapse it and move it freely but if I could have the choice, either in the settings or on the toolbar, to select horizontal or vertical position when free that would be awesome. Seems like it might be an easy addition?

One other thing I really love is the title page, its use for building a table of contents is perfect functionality! However, I don't like the hash marks. I would like to still be able to differentiate the title without effectively crossing them out.  Is there currently a way to disable that or a workaround anyone has found? For future updates, I personally would rather brackets around the title much like the diegest. Or even a box but the hash marks kinda kill it for me.

The only thing I miss about taking notes on paper is that I used a lot of color-coding and go back through and watercolor them. One day a super note with a color E-ink screen,... now that would be pretty sweet..

I'm trying to figure out how to get a pen that is heavier overall because I'm finding I don't press hard enough to get that feeling of resistance anymore.

You covered all of the features and attributes of the three pens extensively, including the writing experiences. Just what I needed to know. These styluses are another reason to love Supernote.

Just one thing I’m curious about — spoiler alert — I assume the HOM pen is also your favourite for drawing, but what about marking up documents where you’d use a stylus to highlight text rather than write? ... Would Lamy’s “gliding over the paper” be better here than HOM’s “digging into the paper” sensation?

Whatever the case, it’s good to see one manufacturer offering high quality pens (plural) that deliver different benefits to different users. I don't own the basic pen, only the Lamy and the HOM, but I agree with you even if my opinion isn't perhaps as strong!

Now I own the Max Lumi, too, but my go-to is still the Supernote for the calendar, general note-making and the reading smaller page-sized PDFs. I just love the feel of the screen with the HOM! The digest annotation feauture, the sharpness of the screen rendering, the ability to star your faviourites, the way you can organise a notebook, the support team, etc., make this one of the best purchases I have made in a long time, and your videos were key to that, so thanks!

"I've been on and off the last few months waiting to get the RM2, until I discovered SuperNote, and I have a few questions.

1) The A5x and A6x are basically the same exact thing, except for the size of the device? I read elsewhere on the reddit that palm-rejection is missing on the smaller one too, but it's on the road map?

&amp;#x200B;

2) As someone who will use the device for taking various notes, how much of a deal breaker is the size of the A6x vs the A5x in your opinion? I may do some lite kindle reading, but I highly doubt it.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Any general reviews, tips, tricks, etc are welcome. I haven't seen much on here, but I've spent time watching videos from CPO, MyDeepGuide, GoodeReader, and a few other channels. 1. They run the exact same firmware, so functionally yes. The screen of the smaller one/A6X is glass and the larger one/A5X is... not-glass (plastic?)... but same film on the screen. The smaller one has higher ppi. The A6X actually does have palm rejection (I use it!) I think I’ve read here the A5X that doesn’t have it yet but I’m not sure. 

2. For note taking, I would base it on your preferred size of paper notebook. I literally tried measuring it out before I bought one to get a feel for the size haha. A6X screen is basically the size of an iPad mini screen. I think it’s a great size because it’s about the size of the notebooks it replaced for me (Moleskine Large)  but it’s really dependent on what you are comfortable with. 

3. [I did a short sort-of-review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/l7rgn5/a6x_initial_reviewfirst_impressions_latency_etc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) when I got my A6X, with some photo comparisons etc. which might help you decide! I'll make sure to check out the review (I started to earlier, but got sidetracked watching some videos on the devices).

&amp;#x200B;

To try and put size into perspective, if it's a standard college-ruled notebook (or maybe a 1-inch binder) how do the devices compare? 2. Keep in mind that the A6 writing area is small. 4 and 5/8 inch by 6 and 1/8 inch. The external size of the A6X is about the size of an A5 notebook. So if you are used a Moleskine or Leuchtturm1917, you'll want to go with the A5X even though the external size of the A5X is bigger than those notebooks. 

3. If you write small like me, you may go with the 0.2 nib size. But on the A5X, the lines look a bit jagged. Ratta is working on this issue. On the A6X, the higher resolution means I find it more comfortable to write in my usual handwriting size without the cognitive dissonance of the jagged lines. But I like having the physical screen real estate of the A5X. One thing that helped me with the nib size issue is to use a finer point stylus. Those are definitely closer to A5X.

The photos in the post I linked show the A6X, open, next to Rhodia and Moleskine notebooks and a Kindle Paperwhite for reference. I don’t share the experience of the poster below at finding it small (you’ll see in the photo the screen width is about the same as a page on a Moleskine), but you sound like you’re used to much larger paper notebooks so I would skew larger!",Opinions,title prediction
"I have a 6X. When I set it down on a metal cart near my work station it goes to sleep so I could not see my notes. I was getting frustrated thinking maybe that was an intended function to save battery or something. Just realized it only happens on the metal cart. When I set it down on another surface it stay on. Maybe an interaction with the magnet that is used to trigger sleep/wake? Hi u/betterwithchem, I have the same issue on a metal Ikea balcony table. The whole A5X actually feels to stick to the table slightly when the cover flap is folded underneath. Try leaving the cover open like a normal book, instead of folding over and underneath the device. I have better results like that usually... That is definetly the sleep function the supernote has for its folio. When ever the folio closes the supernote will go to sleep and when opened it will wake up the supernote. This is done with magnets. Since the table is metal the supernote's think it's the folio in its closed position and it goes to sleep, try placing something like a book or a cardboard between the supernote and the surface to avoid that problem. Maybe even consider using a stand. /u/hex2asc Is there a way we can get a switch in the settings to disable close-to-sleep?

"I use my A5X to take notes primarily, but thinking of trying the RM2 because I have been less than impressed with battery life? Any thoughts? I have the A6X and RM2 and honestly prefer the A6X.  The RM2 seems bulky even though it isn't really.  I like how the a6x feels to write on (though I hate the new movable menu.  HATE), and the RM2 does not feel like paper.  The menus seem more difficult to navigate, though I probably just need more practice.  If yoyve already got the a5x id just stick with that. &gt;already got the a5x id just stick with that.

My thought as well. Battery life on the rM2 is great when the device is idling (not in use) when in use it's not that great, but more than enough. You might get better battery life with the rM2 (don't have both, can't compare) but the difference won't be that big, and the rM2 is more fragile (glass based screen, some people have problem with the little button because it's in a zone that easy to shock, etc.). If you have a SN and it suits your need, no need to bother with the rM2 IMO, unless battery life when idling is your main criteria. Yes, I have both, and I have to say, it's a really tough call between them, but at the moment, I'm leaning more to the A5X.

Points in the RM2's favor:
* Significantly longer battery life
* Best writing feel (in my opinion)
* Calligraphy pen (I love it!)
* Thumbnails show writing on PDFs (this is important to me because I edit a lot of PDFs and it's easier to keep track of what document I've worked on)

Points in the A5X's favor:
* Ceramic nib, no more replacing plastic nibs
* Continued platform development (calligraphy pen coming soon, along with many other developments)
* Wakes up when folio is opened

The ceramic nib is what tips my preference for the A5X: I hate the idea of having to replace nibs every two weeks to a month (depending on how much writing I'm doing) and gives me the mental freedom to write and write without thinking about how I'm wearing down the nib, or ordering new ones, and so on. The fact that Ratta is so responsive to users also stands in stark contrast with Remarkable's radio silence. I know that the Supernote platform will continue to improve, so I'm willing to wait for things like a calligraphy pen. (And they are also working on battery life -- it's never going to reach the same level as RM2's, but I wouldn't be surprised if they managed to get another day out of the existing design.)

If what you're looking for is for someone to assuage your concerns that you may have made a wrong decision, here it is: stick with the A5X, the Remarkable is not significantly better to justify forking over a ton of money for similar functionality. Yes, the battery life is better, and I love the feel, but unless the A5X's battery life is causing you major headaches, stick with what you've got.",Does anyone have Remarkable 2 and Supernote A5X?,title prediction

"I recently returned a reMarkable 2 and replaced it with the A5x. Overall I'm happy with the switch, but there are two features I REALLY miss:

1. The send to reMarkable Chrome plugin which allowed me to send pretty much any article I found online to my reMarkable as a PDF. Amazing! Any chance Ratta could offer something like that?
2. The ability to simply flip the stylus around and use the other end as an eraser. It is so much easier and more natural. And yes, I have the Lamy pen but don't use it at all because my finger often accidentally pushes the erase button. If you print from you desktop and save to your Dropbox folder (if you sync that way) it is just as quick in my experience. 

But I also am on a Mac and don’t like chrome. So I am not the most objective. 

On my iPhone I use the Instaweb browser and it prints to an a5 pdf format which i save to my Dropbox folder and it is quicker and more reliable than the remarkable app in my experience. 

I am supportive of the idea of a chrome plugin. But I think the syncing options on supernote make it unneeded Thank you for your feedbacks. I think something will be change. I haven't found the dropbox synching to be that easy to set up. And it's hard to imagine anything easier than being on a site like The Atlantic, going to the top right of the browser and clicking the button that says ""send to reMarkable"" and having it instantly appear on your tablet.

"Wondering if anyone else lately is noticing issues with the screen? I've had my A6X for about 6 - 8 months, but the last probably month or so am noticing some issues (Tried looking for similar problems but didn't see any, if I've missed this issue posted somewhere else please let me know!)

*Processing video 0vi6y64bq9q61...*

1. Not recognising touch. I've attached a video from this morning. It's not all the time, but happening probably every 2nd day now, it randomly won't recognise touch input - only pen; or vice versa. Restarting does work, but I often have to restart 2 or 3 times for it to work, and sometimes it won't restart (it just sits there refusing to accept either input). 
2. The bottom half of the screen seems to be not always responding properly to pen input. Having trouble filming this, as I notice it mostly during lectures when I'm writing a LOT in a short amount of time, and am willing to accept that it could well be me writing in a hurry and causing the issue. Occasionally when I write, the words/strokes are half missing, like a pen running out of ink. And on the right-hand size, about 1/3rd of the way down, there's a weird ""blip"" section where if I draw a straight line, it instead sometimes curves outwards (again, hard to film, it doesn't seem to do it when I want to hahaha) or if I write on lined templates near there it won't write in that spot, instead bunching the letters up behind it as if I were trying to write off the edge.

I haven't dropped, damaged, banged, spilled anything on, sat near or on a magnetic device, or in any other way I can think of caused any damages to the device, I study from home and it lives on my desk 95% of the time. Any thoughts? I'll try to get a video of the ""low ink"" issue asap. Hopefully this is just a simple thing fixed in the next update :) I have similar issues but mine do not seem as prevalent as yours. At times my A5X will not recognize a finger touch until I use the stylus first. But after I use the stylus once it usually goes back to normal. Yeah, it used to do that rarely, but this has become much more pronounced, and the only fix I can find so far is a restart (or three hahaha). It's not happening often enough to really be a huge problem or anything, but the increase has me a bit worried. And the words not writing properly at the bottom are a bit concerning too, but I'm still not sure if that's just how I'm writing, or a genuine issue. Hey mate, are you still experiencing this issue or did Rata sort it out yet? I've been looking to get one of these devices but have seen this complaint pop up a couple times and am just wondering if its an ongoing thing. I was, and ended up emailing about it, and they replaced the device. I am having some possible issues with the new one, but not sure yet if that's just me (different problem). Regardless, I absolutely love mine, even if there are a few bugs or problems. I think pretty much every company will have issues like this, but the stand-out thing for me is their customer service and support. Even with the issues, they've been fantastic at talking it out and trying to sort out the issues; plus they listen to us as customers when we suggest changes or things we'd like to see.",Screen Issues,title prediction
"I have a couple of custom Note templates I use for meetings. One has a Title/Attendee/Follow Up area at the top that I use as the first page of notes for any meeting, and then when I continue taking notes on the next page, I change to the 8mm rule stock template. Then the next time I have a new meeting for the same client or project, I switch back to my custom template for that first new meeting note page.  


So, my request(s):

&amp;#x200B;

* Can we have an option to sort templates with custom ones first when we go to template selection? That would put my three custom ones first, and then the 8mm ruled one would be immediately following, and I would not need to go to the next page of templates every single time a new meeting comes up.
* In the alternative, give us the ability to rename templates so we can then sort them in any order by name.
* This third is a long shot. Can we specify how many pages a template will be used when selected, and then the one to follow it? So, I can have my custom template selected, and when I go to the next page, it will automatically shift to the ruled template I select as the second page of any meeting. Then I'll only need to select my own template for the first page of a meeting, and not need to select any other. This should override the system default for the Note template.

Thanks! I was thinking last night how much easier it'd be to be able to sort the templates, just hold to rearrange so the most-used are first in the list or something. Most used or last used would work very well for my use case. I just hate to go to the second page of templates for no good reason almost every time I have a meeting. Agreed, I use mine mainly for study and have made up some templates for definitions or equations and some summary sheets for lectures or chapter notes, and having to keep scrolling through them all to set those up for each lecture is not quite ""annoying"" as such, but it would be simplified with the option to arrange how I'd like. It's not a hugely inconvenient thing, but I was uploading more last night and starting to realise just how many I have now, and thinking that it's going to become a bit harder to find what I want (I am a self-confessed digital-hoarder and can absolutely guarantee I'll end up with way more templates than I need or use regularly hahaha) Most used or let the user rearrange the order to their own accord.",Feature Request - Template Sort Order,title prediction

"First, I’d like to thank this forum, as it has been key for my decision to buy this fantastic device. I reserved a Remarkable last summer and changed my mind after being surprised on how responsive the Supernote community was.

I’ve used the A5X for more than 2 months now and I absolutely love it. I’m not the artist-type of user and my goal was to use it as a replacement of my work paper-based notebooks. I have to say the A5X nails it for this purpose.

However, there’s always gap for improvement and I’d like to request some improvements that will make my life easier.

1) Move pages to other notes. Believe this was already requested. To me this is a key feature as the copy-paste is not always working as expected.
2) Improvements in copy-paste. It happened to me a couple of times that I paste something on the wrong place and didn’t find the way to redo the paste. It looks like the clipboard is emptied after the paste so, if you undo it, you lose the copied data. This made me lose some selections and makes me now be very careful with the copy-paste.
3) Digest without comments. I think the digest feature has a lot of potential. I use it intensively as a marker without adding comments. When retrieving the digest I see lots of blank spaces and even an option to remove the “marked” text and keep only the comments. I’d love to have it the other way around. A version without comments, so that I can get a summarized version of the book based on the marked text.
4) Improved sensitivity on the toolbar. Not sure of this but I recently got the feeling that, since I upgraded to one of the latest versions, I need to press harder to make a selection on the toolbar (e.g. switch between the pen and the rubber). This is also a bit annoying as sometimes I have to try 2 or 3 times before getting the correct tool. I believe there has to be a way to increase its sensitivity so that’s easier to select.

I hope my comments help to improve this already-amazing device. Thanks for your feedback and great suggestions! Thanks for your sincere feedback and suggestions. Yes,  the function of moving pages to other notes , which is one of the most important features that will be available in the future, each page is independent which should be moved between different notebook freely , that is similar to a binder.   Additionally,  ""a version without comments in digest"" and ""improving the sensitivity on the toolbar"" will all been submitted  to the IT team for further optimization.   Best Regards Thanks for your quick response as usual.

I have two more requests, I've just realized:

1) Be able to remove ""Star Mark"" from the search. When I search for star marks, it finds  stars that are not viewable in the note. What I mean is that I open the note and I cannot find the start mark. I believe maybe a dot or something very small is detected as a star. As I cannot delete it from the note, I believe the best would be to be able to delete it from the search page (e.g. long press to have the option to delete)

2) Select button on the ""compressed"" floating toolbar. The compressed toolbar is a great idea but I miss the selection button, which forces me to extend it. I think it would be great to have it there together with the pen, rubber, do and undo buttons.",A5X feedback after 2 months,title prediction

"Hi Everyone,

I know these kinds of questions have been asked a lot already, but I would still prefer some feedback on my specific use-case. First things first, I am planning on buying a reader and am deciding between the A5x and the Boox Note Air. I want to use the tablet to read academic journal articles while sitting outside in the sun. Now, most of what I will be doing is just reading, though I will generally do some note-scribbling at the side of pages as well. It sounds as if the Lumi Max would be my ideal option, mainly due to its size, but I don't really want to spend $900 on this so I'm stuck between the A5x and the Note Air. Voya, and others, seem to suggest that the Note Air has a slightly better/faster reader, which, I think, would be very important for me. On the other hand, It's a bit more expensive since you have to get an extra pen and, from my understanding, does not have the same Dropbox support that the Supernote has.

Has anybody tackled the question from a similar standpoint? Would really appreciate some more thoughts.

Thanks I have owned the Lumi and the A5X and prefer the A5X because the screen is more crisp (less layers between base panel and your eyes), the pen is better, the annotation features are smart (digest and stars), it feels more durable and notebook-like, and the company is very receptive to feedback. However, Boox devices are very, very fast. Much faster than the Supernote, although I don’t mind the occasional 1-2 second delay in between gestures etc. because I love what the device stands for. The PDF reflow/crop/landscape mode features on the Boox are more advanced than what the Supernote has currently. The Boox Max Lumi and Note Air don’t feel like very well thought out devices, but their capabilities are very powerful if you know what you are doing in the Android ecosystem. 

Tl;Dr: I owned a Lumi and sold it because the text wasn’t very crisp (too many layers on the screen) and the pen sucked. The A5X is a quality, purpose built device with a perfect pen for notetaking and annotating simpler, one-column a4 PDFs but anything more complex and you will meet its limitations very quick. Some thoughts: the Boox Note Air is based on a Carta screen, it has a thin layer of glass and can break quite easily. The A5X (or Note 3) might be more durable.

A5X is more on a minimalist approach even though it's android based. 

I'd say that there is more chances that you get long term support on the A5X, Onyx tends to release new devices and to forget about older ones, that receive no software updates when new models are released. Hard to tell how Ratta will be on the long run on that front, but from what we can read, them seem to be planning to provide upgrades for longer than Onyx.",A5X vs Note Air for PDF annotating,title prediction

Just wondering how it would holdup when the tip would fall on a hard flour i.e. hardwood or paving stone when in garden. I guess time will tell.

I was torn between 6X and 5X. Mobility versus writing space. I intend to transition from A5 paper notebook BJ, of which I started the 7th now, to the SN. Have scanned in the paper BJ's converted to PDF which I intent to import to SN and create a grant index page. Planning to use/utilise/create a template for daily sheet that has some pre-set goal trackers / quotes or at least space for them that should stay on the page  for a whole month or even year as a reminder and without having to flick pages. So space would be already taken up by that and in that respect the A5x made more sense. A5x also allows more flexibility when going to draw concepts/mindmaps/process diagrams etc.

Also looking forward to using this as a learning driver. For example if one wants to learn all chemical elements you could use one layer to show an empty periodic table and then try to fill out all elements and their properties from memory on another layer and the repeat by deleting the 2nd layer without having to re-draw or print out the table structure and all that without  a paper mess and no need for a printer. I have/tried the Galaxy Tab S7 pen, the Staedtler Noris Jumbo, the HoM, and the standard Sn pen.  The HoM is fine, but the one I use most is the standard pen it came with.  I'm still eying the LAMY, for the eraser button.  But It's hard to justify spending another $60-70USD for a 4th pen (I returned the Jumbo).  

I prefer not having to replace nibs.  I do have the same question about ""impact durability"" though.  Thankfully I haven't yet had to find out.  

I really was using a daily planner template with a Tasks, Meetings-at-a-glance, Quick Notes, and Scratchpad page for every day of the year.  I've fallen out of the habit lately though and pretty much have only been using it for meeting notes.  I like your learning driver method. I also just ordered.

"Hi, everyone! I'm wondering about your experience using the proofreading tools on the Supernote.

If so - why start with a Pentagram? Am I able to turn it off in this version? I'd love a auto-draw feature like procreate has. This would make the Supernote so much more useful! It’s in the manual under Symbol recognition I believe. You can search for the star symbols in your notes/documents Thanks for the quick reply. Missed it in the manual apparently.

What I do is draw the star next to the note.  Then, I can later tap on what looks like a table of contents symbol in the top left of the menu bar, and the star symbol in the right corner of that menu, and see all of the pages I've starred in that file.

My only gripes are: 1) it doesn't always recognize the star when I draw it, and 2) it would be great if I could select some of the text what I starred so I could see it in the ToC view instead of have to jump to the page in order to read it.",What's up with the supernote converting a drawn pentagram into a perfectly drawn one?,title prediction

"I wasn't sure whether to write this post or not. I was planning on using an ewriter to organise all my notes and lists at home (I seem to generate 100's of sheets of paper). The problem for me is it's for personal use and so not offset against tax etc which means I'm fairly price sensitive and these things are unfortunately close to the limit of what I'll pay.

Getting unbiased info on these devices is quite difficult. The youtube reviewers were very positive on the A5X but then they were very positive on every ewriter they reviewed which didn't really help me much. I ended up trawling through hours of reviews trying to work out the pros and cons of every device and tried to work out what would suit me best. In the end I chose the A5X as I liked the design, the ease of use and the extra functionality that keeps getting added. 

Two days ago I thought damn it, I'll just buy it. I knew the discount price was finished and had convinced myself that the full price was worth it. Then a shipping charge of $57 got added. I figured I better check the functionality to make sure I'm getting exactly what I want and stopped the order. A day later, I'd got the answers I needed here, and I thought I should still go ahead and place my order. I picked the standard package. OK'ed the shipping price, then was told about possible extra taxes etc to the UK. I gave up at that point.

I'm sure the A5X is great but I can't test it before buying and it seems I can't even work out what I'm I'll actually be paying. I decided not go ahead and instead just rely on paper and pencil for the moment. Hopefully it will appear on Amazon in the future and hopefully I'll be able to afford it. I hear you. It's expensive. All these ewriters are. And it's certainly not essential. It's a tough call. I decided (i.e., believe without actually trying yet) that it will work for what I'm looking for (one thing is to free me from needing to sit in front of my computer to read and annotate long PDFs). But I agree that it would be so much nicer to have a model one could try first. If I were you I'd stay connected here because if a deal on a used device comes available, your best bet for hearing about it will be right here. I decided to go ahead and order (with all the extra shipping and taxes to Canada), because I think this will make a big difference in my workflow (for my actual job).

I definitely intend to use the first 30 days (during which it can be returned for full refund) to see if I like it, and it provides the functionality I want/need. As you pointed out, buying expensive ""toys"" without being able to try them first is a bit of a leap, but I have NO PROBLEMS shipping it back for a refund if I decide it won't work for me. Frankly, if more people insisted on good return policies, I think we'd all feel better about buying new/unavailable tech (since we would have the comfort of knowing that it isn't money flushed down the toilet if it ends up not working for us). I would look for a used one if you are really price-conscious. I bought one used for about $40 under the price of new. You may have to wait a little bit, but it is possible. There is a thread for used ones for sale.

I would look for the thread here that has used devices for sale. Exactly. The A5 (non-X) can sometimes be found at a very decent price, it could be an alternative if budget is important and a more minimalist device can work out fine for your needs, [u/mike\_bike\_kite](https://www.reddit.com/user/mike_bike_kite/)",Information and pricing,title prediction

"Hi,  


I have just watched a [video](https://youtu.be/CXjYHtfDP6A?t=2372) where a PDF, filled with hyperlinks is used almost as if it was an app. I believe this is very similar to the zettelkasten feature which I've read about on the subreddit.

  
This idea got me really excited and upon arriving at the section which shows the PDF on the A5X (which I preordered) it is clearly mentioned and shown that you cannot follow hyperlinks with a single tap. There's always that menu which shows ""Jump To"" which you have to tap again.  
Is it possible to configure this (or change the default) behaviour? If not, I would like to request this :-)  
It should be easy to implement and could very well live alongside the actual zettelkasten feature.

&amp;#x200B;

thanks,

Crucidal [deleted] The inner hyperlinks within the documents are available on Supernote A5X, the prompt of "" Jump to“ ， which designs to avoid unintentional touch which caused to jump to a certain hyperlink page by accident, which might also cause some "" inconvenience"". I agree that there is an inconvenience in both scenarios. However, the touch is not over sensitive and in my experience, being able to hit the hyperlink is enough secure in itself to avoid most unintentional jumping. To me it would be awesome with an option to turn this off, just like you can turn off touch recognition. The power of freedom and customization :) My current experience is purely from e-readers like the kindle paperwhite.(is it fair to assume this would translate to the a5X as well?)I've never experienced unintentional touches there. The palm rejection should ""fix"" other scenarios in which you might accidentally press a hyperlink.It seems like the Jump To was built to prevent ""annoyance"" for a use case that probably rarely happens in comparison to how often you intentionally press it.

Handling unintentional navigation could also be solved by providing a means to quickly go back to the previously shown page. either by a temporarily hovering menu or a built-in shortcut (like double tapping the lower left corner or something)Purely looking at ""handling unintentional navigation"" my suggestion takes 2 page refreshes and that's definitely slower than the ""jump to"" menu. But if you would multiply this by some weight which represents how often you unintentionally navigate vs intentionally, I think it would outweigh the drawbacks :-)","feature request: A5X directly follow internal links without showing ""Jump to"" menu?",title prediction

"Hi r/Supernote. 

&amp;#x200B;

I purchased my Supernote A5X in January and have been using it for a few months now. I absolutely love it. I basically don't use real paper anymore. Over the past several months, my Supernote has become one of my most precious items -- I carry it around with me everywhere. It contains my calendar (actually, Voya's calendar, it's really great!), my todo lists, my personal journal and diary, my work documents, and my school documents and papers. The Supernote team should feel proud that they have created and commercialized such a fabulous device. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to suggest some features, but I don't want to imply that I'm not fully satisfied with the product. The Supernote has brought me alot of joy and I really am happy. In the future, here's what my perfect Supernote device would look like:

&amp;#x200B;

Reading &amp; Note Taking Improvements:

* **Split Screen View.** I wish I could view a document and a note side-by-side at the same time, especially if I turned my Supernote sideways.
* **No annotation tag.** Annotations in PDFs have a small circular ""D"" or ""A"" symbol at the end of each selection that blocks the text underneath. Do we really need these symbols? It would be great to turn them off, or to somehow move them to the side so I can read the text underneath. 
* **Improve the Underlining/Annotating Experience.** When trying to underline a sentence in a PDF, it is too easy to grab (1) the leading whitespace before the first word or (2) the trailing whitespace after the last word or period. It would be great if Supernote was smart enough to omit leading and trailing whitespace characters when underlining.
* **Free the Title.** In a Note, do ""Titles"" really need to be obscured with dark diagonal slashes? What is the point of hiding the text underneath the Title? Perhaps I don't understand this function. Wouldn't it be better if, instead, the text was surrounded by a box that you could see through? Why do I want dark squares in my Note? Why do I want to hide the Title?
* **Change the Lasso Icons.** I feel like the lasso icons are backwards. After I lasso a word or phrase in a Note, the box with a ""T"" in it is *not* for ""Title"" -- it creates a keyword. And the box with ""dots and lines"" is not to create keywords, but to create a ""Title"". I keep getting these mixed up because ""T"" = ""Title"". Am I thinking about this wrong?  I feel like these icons should be swapped, or changed completely.
* **Use UTF-8 Encoding in Digest.** The Digest does no seem to have a full set of UTF-8 fonts. For example, the South Korean won symbol, ₩, does not show correctly in the Digest.

&amp;#x200B;

PDF Improvements:

* **PDF to Note copying.** I want to be able to copy text from an annotation/digest (i.e., the text that I have underlined) and paste it into a Note file.  
* **PDF Snip Tool.** I wish I could lasso an area of a PDF and the copy that over to a Note as an image. 
* **Add Layers to PDFs.** Right now, layers only work in Notes. It would be nice to be able to use layers on top of PDFs. 
* **Copy Written Doodles from PDF to Note.** I wish I could write a little note and/or doodle in a PDF and then cut/copy that into a Note. 
* **Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus.** I want a dictionary and thesaurus feature for PDFs and ePubs (and, Notes?). The Kindle app comes bundled with one, but I can't use that feature outside of Kindle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Potential Bugs:

* **Fix E-mail Typo.** When you enter an incorrect e-mail address (e.g., ""supernote@.com"" is an incorrect e-mail address format) then the error message says ""Please check mailbox"" instead of ""please check e-mail address.""
* **Clean up Keywords.** In a Note, when I lasso a word and mark it as a keyword, it appears as a keyword in the menu. Great. But, when I erase the keyword in the Note, the keyword still appears in the menu. Is that normal? 

&amp;#x200B;

Miscellaneous / Other:

* **Creating geometry.** I want to be able to tap two points on my Supernote device with the pen and have a straight line drawn between them. That's it. That's the feature. I just want to draw straight lines between two arbitrary points. 
* **Creating tables.** I want to be able to tap on my Supernote device with the pen and drag it down to create a table (e.g., a 3x3 or 5x5 or 7x7 table). 
* **Search for Keywords in Digest.** I wish I could search for some text in my Digest (not the notes I make in my Digest, but rather the digest printed text itself). 
* **More Quick Access.** Right now, Supernote only allows 4 Documents and/or Notes in the Quick Access area. I wish I could have a more, especially since adding a 5th document/note completely removes the 1st, and unlinking the 5th does not restore the original 1st. 
* **Quick Access List Reordering.** I wish I could reorder the documents and notes shown in the Quick Access list. But this only makes sense if the documents/notes in the Quick Access area are some how ""sticky"" or ""permanent"". My A5x is scheduled to arrive Monday, and this list looks like a great way to help me get started (in terms of ""things that might not work the way I thought they would""). I hope the supernote team sees this, are they active here? Can you actually ""page"" them so they can be sure to see it? This is a great, carefully considered list of requests and I agree with the vast majority of them.

The biggest one, for me, is the ability to draw straight lines between two points. That would solve a big pain point.

Otherwise, like you, I love this thing. Three months in and it’s now indispensable. Yeah, I use a ruler to draw straight lines, like on pen and paper! xD Super notes does review comments, I was hoping they came out with a calendar with reminders.

Thanks!! Square brackets? These create a separate doc called a digest where you can add your notes relating to that section of the pdf. You click on the text to take you to the digest page.

Received custom import tax payment request via email from DHL on 30. April 7:05 am GMT. Paid right after, process was straight forward. (€129 for Ireland with 23% VAT).

"Hi all

*I posted similar to the below in the remarkable subreddit not realising a5x had a sub.

I'm a Psychologist based in Australia and I'm looking to go digital with my in session note taking. I'm looking for some advice as there's a lot of options.

I think I'm leaning towards the a5x or papyr. I've been watching morning coach and my deep guide most of the morning and it seems that these two devices have improved since release/have good customer service.

How would the a5x go with the below?

Priority
- Note taking/writing is #1 for sure
- Custom note templates (I use a session note template)
- Ability to easily erase what I write
- Ability to export/email my notes to my computer
----- If I could export to a specific folder on my computer that would be ideal
- Ability to create flowcharts/diagrams etc easily as I often use a whiteboard in session

Bonus features
- Would be great if I could export my notes to a specific folder on my computer
- I often put a sticky note on my session note to remind me of things to bring up with the client, but I'm not sure if any device could replicate this?
- Being able to bring up pdfs/highlight and write on them
- Ability to screenshare
- Ability to create a to do list
- Handwriting to text. My hand writing is pretty chicken scratch, but this could be useful in future as I write the same words a lot (so text prediction too)

If anyone has any other suggestions I would be more than happy to hear them. I love my A5X and think it checks off all of your must have boxes and many of your bonus features as well. 

* I really like the writing experience and find it very natural and easy to write on. 
* You can set the note template to be anything you want. There are tons of community created templates and creating custom ones is very simple and straight forward. 
* If you go with the standard or HOM supernote pens, you don't get an eraser button but I don't find it a hassle to switch to the eraser  in the tool bar. I also like the lasso eraser feature a lot and find it easy to use. 
* I have my supernote synced via dropbox. So whenever I choose, all of the files are synced to my computer for reference. You can set up specific folders in dropbox and the files will transfer flawlessly between them. I've never had an easier cloud-syncing experience. 
* I'm not quite sure what you mean by creating diagrams. With Supernote, you are able to draw like you would on a piece of paper. They've hinted at potentially adding drag and drop shapes to notes as well.
* Supernote has several options for marking up and bookmarking documents so you can go back to them later. This might work fo you. 
* You can bring up and write on PDFs. Highlighting is a little strange because its only B/W but it does work.
* Screen sharing is not an option :(
* There are to do list templates and quick access features that make to do lists a breeze to create and update on supernote. 
* I think they are working on handwriting to text for notes but it's not an option yet. 

I cannot recommend supernote enough. I really like the design decisions that Ratta made. The pen loop and aluminum rail system keep the pen and device attached to the folio in a more secure way than magnets do. The writing experience feels great. And the supernote team has been so responsive and listens to the community. This is massively helpful - thank you. You've answered everything so I really appreciate it. I'll have to make though I can avoid using the cloud when it comes to client related notes while still having the ability to export/email them to myself. So I'll ask supernote about that. You can also transfer via usb. 

There is an email function, and I assume that you can send attachments via it (but I haven't used it as I wanted a distraction free device for writing)",Questions on a5x features,title prediction
"Hello Supernote users! I recently updated my Supernote A5X (the day after the newest update came out) and the new features are really great additions. However... the past two days I noticed immense battery drainage. I left my half-charged (give or take) Supernote overnight, waking up to 6%. The day after, left an 85% charged device, only to find it at 55%. Now, this is a HUGE battery drainage problem... and if this is coming from the update, I'm wondering if anyone else had noticed it AND if anyone has considered going down one update for this very reason? As much as I like being able to save my notes as a vector, the last thing I need is my device to feel like my phone, something to constantly be worried about with battery life.

"Hi Can we turn off the jump to request? I have hyperlinked PDF files and I would like to navigate a tad faster by clicking only once?

PS. In love with my A5X xx Our team has discussed this internally. The reason why there is no direct jump is that we lack a shortcut for ""go back"". If the user accidentally triggers the jump, it is inconvenient to return to the previous page. We are developing a convenient way to go back, and at that time, we will enable direct jumps. :) Perfect, thanks ! That's an interesting problem. I know I'm biased here, but I imagine the number of users wanting to go forward with one click far outweighs the number of exceptions of a miss click.

It's just a shame to see videos of the REmarkable clicking through at a high pace for a nice UX feel and the A5X having that friction of double touch...even though you've already built the equivalent capability.

I am being tempted by the Remarkable's texture and pen tool.  Convince me otherwise!

I have ordered the LAMY pen to compare the difference and ordered the Remarkable knowing I can return.  I do a LOT of drawing and my senses are highly sensitive.  I thought I read somewhere about someone who's screen was more textures on. one device than another.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there a way to get a more textured (less slick) drawing experience on the Supernote? Screen protector? Pen?
2. Anyone know if there is a Pencil tool in the works?

(Please know, as much as I am enjoying RM2, Supernote has my heart) No and I don’t know. Just stick with the RM2 if you like drawing. 1.No, you can't add a screen protector because you already have one and you can't remove it because the ceramic pen works with it. For me the first advantage of the ceramic tip is that the tip is thinner.

2) Yes, the pencil brush will be available soon and I look forward to it. The algorithm is done since the beginning of the year, you can see a demo on Supernote's Twitter here :

"I know another one of these threads. I promise I read through as much as I could before posting here but want some fresh perspectives on this given my needs with a device like this.

Both of these devices seem great but I'm torn on which one to get. For my use, I'll only be writing (no drawing or sketching) and I'll primarily be using the device for work meeting notes, to do lists, and daily bullet journaling. I will not use the eReader functionality (already have a Kindle for that) or the PDF viewer/markup functionality. This will be a purely writing device for me. I watched some YouTube videos and both have pros and cons and I can't figure out which one is best for my use. 

The reMarkable 2 looks beautiful and is super thin, which is nice. I also like its UI much better than the Supernote UI - I don't feel like I'll be multi-tasking on a device like this much as I won't be going back and forth between a PDF and notes or anything like that and I don't mind a couple extra presses to get back to my notes (though it looks like rm2's upcoming 2.7 firmware is going to add improved navigation for quickly switching between documents too). The rm2 also has the better OCR, which is something I know I'll use frequently. I already used this often on my Surface to convert handwritten notes. The remarkable 2 also exports writing in a non-rasterized format which is a nice pro. 

The A5X has much better organization options like bookmarks and searching - which would be immensely helpful. The pen is also looking like a huge plus here. I love real luxury pens and own a few fountain pens. So the options Supernote offers are really nice. Plus not ever having to replace the nib is huge and seems like it'd be a nice money save over time. The Supernote also seems to make templates much easier to create and use - which I would for things like my bullet journaling.

My final concerns are price and support. I could use a referral code for the rm2 and get it for over $100 cheaper than the A5X. But I've also heard bad stories of remarkable's support and it's nice to see Supernote engaging with the community. But I also worry that despite that engagement, if something goes wrong I have to send things back overseas which could be expensive or cause long delays (I'm in the US).

Would love to hear the thoughts of people who were trying to decide between the two as well. Especially if you use your device similar to how I described I would above. Thanks! Tough call. Personally, I ended up returning my RM2 and went for the Supernote, see my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/n2ieu3/advice_a5x_vs_rm2/gwyemv3/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Then again, my use case is different.

Why don't you try out the Remarkable and see how you like it? (They offer free returns, after all.)

One thing I'd keep in mind: The writing experience. This is a very personal thing and, personally, I prefer the feeling of the Supernote. &gt; see my comment here

Thanks for that. Helpful. Your points about the areas rm2 wins are also things to consider. Seems like the responsiveness is better. Also the recent 2.6 update seems to have fixed the jagged lines issue on the remarkable. 

&gt; Why don't you try out the Remarkable and see how you like it? (They offer free returns, after all.)

This is a good point. Though I'd feel bad about using someone's referral code only to return the device so they don't get the credit.

Honestly though, if the Remarkable 2 had bookmarks and tags that were searchable it'd probably win for me pretty easily. Though I'd still be lusting after the Supernote's pens and nibs you don't need to replace. I use my device primarily for note taking and planning.  (Consulting on clients). I also purchased both to see which would be better.  SUPERNOTE won.  For me it came to writing, my handwriting needed a .5 and the RM2 was not fine enough and when I switched to the pencil thin, it was too light and hard to read.  As much as I liked the look and feel, it was a deal breaker.  Also, the nib replacement just seemed a hassle.  Love the durability of Supernote.  Supernote can save to cloud or OneDrive which I like, but there is a lot more storage on Supernote than RM2.
Would like to see more “helpful” hints from the company but right now the 3rd party people are doing a nice job for me.
Hope this helps! Thanks. I appreciate this perspective. The pen is a huge reason why I'm still unsure which one to go with. The Supernote's pens all seem superior to anything else on the market - both in feeling like a real pen and also the thinness of the nib. Definitely something I'm putting a lot of weight behind. But so much else about the rm2 seems better for my use cases.",Supernote A5X or reMarkable 2?,title prediction

"Hello Supernote team!  
I just recently purchased a used Supernote device and love the fact that you promote the second hand market for Supernote devices, instead of trying to squash it (I am looking at you Apple!). The ability to buy and sell Supernote devices is amazing because it not only gives a Supernote buying ""*insurance""*  that they can sell the device if it does not work for them, or help those who cannot pay full price afford one, but it also helps keep ewaste out of the landfills.   


That said, while going through the process of finalizing a deal there we were a couple things that concerned/annoyed me though.   
1. Very few rules - Normally anytime you are buying and selling something on Reddit the subreddit has strict rules that help prevent scams. Some of these include recent timestamped photos, addition to the universal scammer list, only allowing payment through paypal goods and services, having the buyer/seller say which state they live in, and a flair that shows how many trades a user has. A perfect example of these rules is r/hardwareswap and r/AVexchange. Implementing some of these rules would greatly help everyone avoid scams.  


2. Hard to find people selling - People who were selling their devices often not only used the trades mega thread but also made new posts or commented on other posts. This caused an issue where it was hard to know if you were seeing all the people interested in selling their devices or not.   


3. Vague price history - Often times the original post showing the final sale price was gone so it was hard to determine what a good deal was or not. Making sure these stay up would greatly help everyone know they are getting a good deal. 

4. Sellers not including screenshots or condition - Most of the time sellers did not include a link to pictures/timestamps of their device so it was hard to detriment what exactly they were selling in what condition.   


Ways to implement these suggestions:  
I think that the best possible way to keep the Supernote market safe and avoid blocking out other content in this subreddit is to create a new subreddit specifically for buying/selling/trading Supernote devices. This new subreddit would then be added to the USL (universal scammers list) and would have strict rules on how people can make posts. Any person who wanted to buy/sell a device could then make a post and the seller/buyer could sort these posts by new in the subreddit getting an up to date list of the resent buying/selling requests. Flairs could be added to further improve the process with Buying, Selling, and Closed tags being used to show the status of a post. Lastly, each post would be able to include pictures and a detailed title so that the buyer and seller can meet quickly and effectively.  


Thanks so much for reading our feedback! I hope this post is helpful. Thank you for sharing your opinion with us, to avoid scams and make our users can get a Supernote device through a trustful channel is our wishes. Hope our users can be more cautious and prudent during the transactions of a used device. What we can do is limited at this stage, look forward to a chance to discuss more with you in the future.

"I've had an issue with my Supernote A5 since I got it almost a year ago and I was wondering if anybody else had the same problem.

I cannot charge the device with a USB-C to USB-C cable. It works fine with the included USB-A to USB-C cable, and with any other A to C cable I've tried. But if the cable is USB-C on both ends (like the MacBook charger) absolutely nothing happens. I've tried this with multiple cables and multiple transformers with the same (lack of) results.

Does anyone else have this issue, or do I have a faulty device? This is frustrating because it means I need a dedicated charger for my Supernote, while the rest of my devices (laptop, phone, keyboard, etc) can all charge from the same cable. If it is a problem with the device, is there any way to get a fix or replacement? Bit surprised you haven't contacted CS if it's been happening for almost a year. I think there were a few customers who had problems with the included cable last year but it can't be that if you've tried multiple cables and chargers. 

Feedback to customer service, via your device, is your best course of action. There are the usual things to try, hard reset, swapping cable around, clean the port (but then you've got it to work with USB-A) etc or it could be a software fault. I'm sure they'll help you resolve your problem I was actually waiting until I got around to getting another cable and adapter to test it out before contacting customer service, and to make sure it wasn't just something about the the USB hardware they use.

I'll contact them, thanks.

I use my Supernote A5 for a lot of grading, and overall it works great for getting feedback to students. I don't use Google Classroom but I can speak to the other aspects of the workflow.

The workflow is a little awkward, however. It's easy enough to get a folder full of PDFs of the student submissions onto the device and to mark them up. But because the Supernote wants to leave the original PDF untouched, you need to export each marked-up document individually (as far as I know there is no way to export an entire folder in one action). This takes usually betweeen 5 and 30 seconds per document depending on its length, which interrupts the grading flow a bit. The exported files are in a totally different directory, named the same as the original document. I usually end up manually copying these files somewhere to be uploaded back to my LMS.

I would **love** it if they implemented an ""export entire folder"" option, or else if there were some way to have the exporting of marked-up PDFs happen automatically in the background.

There might be a smoother workflow with Word .docx files if you get an X-series Supernote.

Still, the Supernote has made marking up student papers and essays *much* easier overall. I no longer need to either (a) print them all out or (b) fiddle with PDF markup on my computer.

Hope this helps a bit! Thank you. This definitely helps! How do your students feel about your comments? Are they able to see and read them easily? Aside from my bad handwriting, yes!

The annotations are a bit pixelated but nobody seems to have had an issue yet. Also, I think the pixelation issue has been solved on the X-series with vector-based exports (which is allegedly coming to the A5 … *eventually*?)",Question about use with Google Classroom/Drive,title prediction
" Hi! Since this morning I’m having a problem when trying to update my a5x, and some more issue. When I try to update it (I’m still at 238 version), through settings&gt;system&gt;software update&gt;check, it just tells me the device is updated. Wifi connection, of course, is on, and I can check my email, but I cannot synchronize though supernote cloud, because when I try, it immediately opens the last doc I read. And finally, if I try to upload the log (system&gt;feedback&gt;upload logs), it tells me “upload failed”. I restart and reboot 3 times, and no variations. Please, give me some indications about what I’m supposed to do. Thanks It should've updated around two weeks ago. My advice is to contact customer service via email and include your device number.

" Thanks a lot! Very good video as always :) I agree with you, it may be missing an option to choose the type of eraser but anyway we will enjoy it ! Just have to be patient for the ""X"" owners. I'm using the 5X this morning, and really miss the erase gesture already! lol Could you tell us if this gesture is possible to execute while holding the device in one hand and writing with the other? Or are you forced to put down the device on your lap or table? I wonder if this specific use case was a part of the troubleshooting when Supernote developed this gesture, u/mulan_sn or u/hex2asc? I've been trying to imitate the gesture on my A6X, but find it a bit difficult to find a natural/working way for two fingers to touch while holding the device in my left hand and the pen in my right hand. The whole premise of the two finger gesture suggests that you have a free hand available in the first place but it's *not impossible* to get two fingers on the screen using the hand holding the device. 

However, as stated from your own trial, it's really awkward and very uncomfortable to get the finger positioning right to successfully activate the function. 

The developers have done a lot of work to refine the gesture and activation zones to prevent as much accidental or false positive activation as possible due to extra stray fingers on the screen including the writing hand making contact with the screen while writing.",Supernote A5 and A6 UPDATE!

"I was just eagerly waiting for my Supernote to be shipped. The long waiting time is not great but is something I understood but I had to cancel my order 3 days before shipping since I looked randomly into the return policy.  Not free return policy and good will return for such devices is just not what I expect. Do you by any chance live in the US?

I read complaints about a lack of free international returns but tbh that's not the norm where I live and, I think, a lot of the world... so calling it *a joke* is a bit harsh and a little US (and maybe EU?)-centric. If I bought a Remarkable, for example, their free return policy wouldn't apply to me since I live in Asia. I guess I would wait for them to set up US/EU warehouses for cheaper shipping in your case.

Edit: The only places I know of here with free international returns are big companies like Lazada (owned by Alibaba; think Amazon) that do logistics in massive volume. How long does this company take to ship? I ordered my A6 X four days ago and have yet to receive a confirmation email. I have only gotten the PayPal receipt. I know they are supposed to have good customer service, but I would at least like to know that my order is being processed. Usually ships within a few days and as far as I remember they sent me a despatch email ( though that doesn't always mean the parcel is physically with the carrier.) I do remember that the tracking was slow to update. See whether anything comes through by Monday then pop them an email to check. Could be they're just busy. Appreciate that we'd all like a free return. However, some people buy it just to try it out, some order at least two devices from different companies with the sole intention of only keeping one. They are a relatively new company, so if a lot of people send devices back, they're losing money. Perhaps, one day they'll be in a position to but likely it could increase the cost for others.

There is the option of selling it, as others have done.

Method 1: Then click the PDF on the cloud page, it will automatically download the exported PDF after clicking and converting (with the .mark files)   
  
Please do not download from the cloud directly without the above steps, otherwise, it is possibly to download the original “blank” pdf without annotations.  
   
Method 2: You can also open/click the exported pdf with annotation from the My device-&gt; Export folders, (The exported pdf will be downloaded automatically)  
  
Additionally，when exporting the PDF on the device, whether you choose “original” or “Vector”. For a vector pdf, If the pdf parsing software cannot open it ( or open without annotation), please try to open it directly with a browser.  
Not sure that whether it is clear enough, please try it. It worked - Thank you!!

Mike I don't have my device yet - it's currently in transit from China. So I can't help you with the first couple. But the pen is not magnetic. They recommend you use the case because it has the pen holder loop on the side for it. 

And as far as I know, the Kindle app only lets you connect to the Kindle service. I'm *pretty sure* you have to use the built in reader to read epub and pdf files you transfer to the device. 1- You don't need the Kindle app to view ebooks. Kindle app is only for accessing kindle books. Supernote can read most ebook formats. Edit: To use LAN, you need the Supernote Partner App.

2- You can put those files anywhere. But the ideal place to do it is in the Documents folder. Putting them in the Notes folder may cause some confusion.

3- Check your email or spam for a privacy or insecure connection alert to enable it.

4- No. You can keep the cap in the pen loop. If you have the standard pen and not HOM, it will be roomy in the pen loop. Many thanks.

Don't suppose you know why the USB won't connect? It seems I can write to the supernote cloud drive and then sync.

"Hello

I have supernote A5x and A6x. I need the two devices to have the same content.

I'm logged in on both devices with the same account (email address). They are not mirroring. on the ratta supernote cloud, it only shows the A6x's content

I've tried to log out and log in on A5x: doesn't work... 

what do I have to do ? Curious about this question myself.  Thinking of getting an A6X for the smaller form factor.  But if they are treated as completely discrete devices and there are no seamless integration options, despite them sharing the same email account, why not consider a non-Sn as a second device just for variety? X series can share the same account(login with one account), while the non-X series can share the same account. You can log in on your new device with your existing Supernote account.  
  
Users need to be careful to keep both devices in sync with each other. Generally, the steps are like following:  
1: A6X writes notes  
2: A6X  sync  
3：A5X sync  
4: A5X writes notes again.  
.......  
Repeat the above steps

I second this. I have an A6X and A5X and they sync with each other fine. Same for me. I have A5X and A6X, and the content syncs fine.

Re Google. Sure it's been mentioned/requested, so believe it'll be possibility in a future update but don't take this as gospel. I work with two devices A5x and A6x, and they can be synced if you what entails correspond to your needs:

1. **Sync is manual, and therefore, not real time**. That means that when you do a change on your device you need to do **every time** you want to use ""collaborative"" documents.
   1. press the sync button on the top drawer, to check if any change has been made since the last sync by someone else
   2. make the changes you need to do
   3. press again the sync button to make sure what on the cloud mirror the content of your device
   4. hoping that no one is doing the same on another device (see 3 below)
2. **Sync does sync the notes but not the ""smart annotation""**. See here point 3, on my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/nnr2nv/do_annotations_exist_outside_my_a5x_or_a6x_device/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). If that's what you need upvote the post linked.
3. **Sync granularity is the file level**, I think, but unsure. I, personally, notice that if I want to sync two devices at the same time, there is an alert on the second one, saying that the cloud is already busy syncing on another device. **What I fear it means is that** : during the time device A is syncing (making some useful changes; let's say to your task list), you can't sync. Then, when the cloud is done syncing A, you start syncing your device B. If, for some reason, the changes you made to the task list on device B is ulterior to the one made on device A, that (probably) means, you'll overwrite changes made by device A, **losing device A changes**.

Based on these remarks, and the fact that you have a team of 8 people (imagine this hassle is x8), **I would recommend going for a device that as a granularity of stroke change, and is in ""real time""**.

If you want to stay in e-inks, I would therefore recommend looking **Mobiscribe Origin: MobiShare**. Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/K35CFZlKC9M) testing the sharing capabilities.

"Thank you for the new firmware update. It adds some very useful features.

Is there any way that you could add pressure sensitivity adjustment/calibration in a future update? I have several styli which I find more comfortable than the Supernote stylus and the default pressure sensitivity is far too high for them. 

Also, in a previous firmware version, the button on a Lamy EMR stylus triggered the selection erase tool when held down. It now does nothing. Can this be re-instated as it was a very useful feature? The eraser on other styli still works fine.

"Since A6X is on Android, I *supposed* we can install Microsoft OneNote app, and take notes directly into MS OneNote.  Supernote, can you please comment if this is possible? Yes, As it's an Android device, you may do that. But you have to wait a few months. At the beginning, we will block any third-party APP until A6X runs stability.

And I should inform you that handwriting latency will increase by using OneNote. Because of slow refresh rate of E Ink Screen, Supernote's note app access the display layer directly. We call this EPA technology (EPaper Accelerator) while OneNote does nothing special for that.

We will not exclude attempts to install third-party applications, and we will establish an application store to encourage users to help us collect applications suitable for ink screens.

For us, our main goal is to develop note-taking application, which needs to be adapted to the disadvantages of gray scale display, low refresh rate and so on. It should perform better than other apps while runs on E Ink Device.

So I think you will have opportunity to try both solutions, from MS or from ours. :) Hi Bruce!

Thanks for the transparent insight :) I agree about your view about the technology and the consumer demands and I hope that your decision will pay off.

One of my concerns with Android as an OS of choice is the latency. Can you say that there will be no decrease in latency (even better, an improvement) with using Android? (The EPA tech sounds great!)

Also, as it is an Android-based software, is it okay to expect some basic functionalities as Web browser, keyboard pairing, etc?

I am really happy that your company is very communicative. Can't wait to join the fam! (would be super cool if you'd have a EU warehouse ;) ) Appreciate the communication and transparency in this.  :)

Perhaps another way for me would be to OCR it in A6X's note taking app, and then export it to OneNote then. This is a good idea!  If we plan to export doc/docx format, why not add one more format as OneNote. We will check that if we can do.",Will A6X be able to sync to Microsoft OneNote?,title prediction
"Is there a reason that Supernote have sent 8 emails about their A6X pre-order offer in the last 30 minutes? There doesn’t appear to be an option to unsubscribe either, which is a bit naughty these days?

Personally, although I really do want to get a Supernote A6X , I’m not going to pre-order anything until I see something a bit more concrete than some screen shots. Not the most thought-out piece of sales literature. Where are the specs, has the latency improved, what are the differences between A6 and A6X...... anything?!  Eight emails,  It's very high treatment. I think they see you as a big buyer. :) We should say sorry, It seems they send everyone 8 emails... It's our mistake.

"Anyone else feel that they are really missing the ability to search for a specific word in their handwritten notes?

I primarily would use this device to take meeting notes. That is the reason Im holding back from buying at this point. SUPERNOTE doesn't have the ability to search hand written notes at this time. However the A6X migth have the ability when it comes out but for mi used I think is too small I need the A5 with that fuction. I really think that constraint is that they don't have OCR readily on their Linux OS (on the other hand, it's one of the main features of the Remarkable). As a consequence, one cannot really map the handwriting to the alphabets for searching..

Prolly also that the software is originally introduced in Chinese/Japanese, so English support is minimal.

Maybe Android will change things as there are lots existing solutions out there. Let's see =) But do you personally feel that you need to search through your notes sometimes? Of course! It's also on my wish list as well. But I could imagine it not being on the top of their priority especially the introduction of the new OS.

"Was quite interested in getting an A5 but was really put off by the fact that there is no way of returning an opened device. I have bought devices in the past that might have worked well for others but just didn't suit me. And so, in less than a few days, they were returned. Given that there is no place for me to try the device, I think it's pretty unfortunate there is no return option. I understand they are a small company that's just starting out but I'd also have been okay if they charged a restocking fee. 

How do you guys feel about their no return policy? Just wanted some different perspectives. I understand your concerns. Our marketing department will internally discuss the return policy in order to better serve our users, especially those early customers who find us. Thank you very much for kind understanding.

As for return policy, we assume Supernote buyers are familiar with E-paper device and operation system and here are reasons we put the policy.

Some customers had impulse buy with less consideration of the need they really want. We would like to avoid such lose-lose result.

We have been suffering by free return policy for some surprising reasons, such as

\- The display size is too small or too big

\- No color display

\- Just dislike it anymore

\- Need some cash back urgent for other

Please understand that we provide one-year warranty with free replacement and DHL delivery for obvious malfunctions or defects as a responsibility to customers, but we cannot afford for nonsense return. We fully understand that most customers are reasonable and kind, but things keep happening. We are a young company doing all we can to improve our product for people's daily lives.

We know this is never a cheap purchase so we appreciate every customer who places order and uses Supernote to make daily life more efficient and meaningful as our 4F slogan: Feel &amp; Find, Free &amp; Fun. It’s not great, especially when they are expecting customers to purchase, at least at the moment, based on a “goodwill” policy, in that there is hardly any info at all available on the A6X. 
I dunno about anyone else, but I would always try and get as much info as possible on something that was going to cost me several hundreds of pounds, but that info isn’t available. I really do understand that there will be timewasters, people who don’t like the colour, etc, but you’d like to think those were in the minority. The point made about a restocking fee seems fair, perhaps something along the lines of even half the purchase price, so it would sting if you sent it back,(for non-defect reasons, obviously ), but wouldn’t be a complete loss for either side?
I’m waiting for two things before purchasing the A6X, one is more information, videos, specs etc and the other is a European distributor so I don’t end up having to pay a third of the price in shipping and taxes! That's a really disappointing reply that I think you copy/pasted from somewhere else in this thread or your website (so no real discussion?). I have mentioned maybe even instituting a restocking fee to discourage frivolous returns from customers. You haven't addressed that. None of the examples you mentioned (why people return devices) capture the writing experience, that's the one thing we can't test by watching videos. ""the no returns due to a small percentage of potentially bad customers"" approach doesn't reciprocate the goodwill you seem to be expecting from your customers. 

Anyhow, you guys are allowed to run your company however you think is best and I wish you all the best for that.",No returns on opened devices?,title prediction

" Thanks, good share.  I understand Mandarin (Chinese) so here are some takeaways:

Looks like there are some interface changes on the tool bar and also the way the notes are displayed.

10:40 - The Lamy pen feels the same as the 1st generation heart of metal pen (Plastic nib). The reviewer said there's a bit of ""stickiness"" feeling when writing.  He feels that the 2nd generation ceramic nib feels better when writing. 

12:20 - He was comparing the Weixin ebook reading app, I think.  He mentioned the speed seems to be comparable with another ebook reader and looks nice.  Chinese Font on the A6X seems to be smaller and doesn't seem to have a setting to change that in the Chinese ebook reader app he is using.  

13:37 - He mentioned the writing experience is quite good.  Will be continuing further reviews as he uses the A6X in the coming weeks. Thanks so much! I received one. 
I can do a quick video if that helps.

Can confirm the stickiness of the Lamy nib, don’t have ceramic to compare. 

Shout your questions and I’ll answer :) Thanks! :)  Can you please share your experience of the ebook reading?  Things I'm looking at:

\- Table of content

\- Annotations: is it easy (just write directly?)

\- Can you export annotations easily?

\- Can you still draw a line across the screen and then do note taking split screen?

\- Press-and-hold on a word for dictionary (is it available yet)?

"I have a Onyx Boox with note taking from work, but the A6X appeals to me.  However, I've found it very hard to make pencil-like sketches due to the lack of pressure sensitivity to opacity on the Onyx.  Though the brush gets thinner with low pressure, it's still 100% pure black.

Most of the first pre-orders have been shipped and many customers in Japan, China, Europe and the U.S. have already received the A6 X. We look forward to you sharing your creations on the A6 X!

1. The region selection edit tool affects the erasing effect.

2. Margins are too large (EPUB)

3. Confusion caused by two different entrances, the right tag bar and the file manager.

Personally, I want to have one of those eink device to take notes at work, read epub pdf and blogs. So the only think really missing on A5 is the browser.

Any thoughts on that?

For the A5, it is harder to integrate a browser, but out of concern for our users, we will try out as many solutions as possible, without guaranteeing results. If the browser is crucial to you, ""X"" series could be a better option at this stage.

"Hi, I've just updated my A6X with the C.063 firmware. Thank you for the correction on the selection tool after the erasing action. It works. 😊

I wanted to tell you I found the following bugs:

- Eraser: with the previous version, when I chosed the ""region eraser"" or used the eraser on the Lamy pen I could delete just a part of a continuos stroke, just the area I selected. With the update I can only erase a complete stroke, even if I select just a part of it. And if I choose the ""regular eraser"" I cannot change its thickness, even if I go to ""pen"", change its thickness and then ""regular eraser"", it is always small.

- Folders: I still find the confusion we had on the previous version, but now I know that if I want to see the files stored in a folder I have to use the side bar, go to Inbox and then select the folder I need. It would be just great if I could see my files even if I choose for example ""Documents"" or ""Notes"" on the side bar and then select the correct folder.

- Png: I don't know why, but when I select a png file, the device tells me ""Unsupported file format"". I can see the thumbnail, but can't open it. It happened also with the previous version.

I know you are working hard on further updates, so maybe you are able to add some of these amendments.
And thank you for this amazing device! Hey there,

Thank you for your detailed feedback.

Eraser: To improve user-friendliness, we are optimizing the region erasing algorithm for a smarter approach.

Folders: in this release we have only tweaked the UI to reduce confusion and will bring subsequent improvements in later updates.

One option to go around this problem is to use the star mark. You basically draw a star on a page and the device recognizes it. After, you can search for star marks in any note document you have and it will display small sized pages where you have a star. Therefore, if you underline some important keyword on a page with one of these marks, you can find that word with no problem. So it's still better than a regular paper notebook. Also consider that you don't have to use paper or carry tons of notebooks with you. Everything is in one device. It is fast, good to write on, and everything is tidy and accessible.
I have been using A5 device everyday for roughly a month now. I use it as a notebook and (mostly) as a PDF reader. Besides the very good writing experience, fast processing, etc., the best part is that I don't use paper anymore and everything is cleaned and organized from the beginning. I would recommend it.
That being said, if you really need a handwritten notes conversion function and don't want to tackle the problem by the means that supernote offers, there may be other devices on the market more suitable for you. Yes, we have the same idea as you. So we made a similar function in A6X. My colleague will post a video later, please confirm if this is what you want.

Once this function is approved by our users, we will apply it to A5/A6. Hi there, you can convert your handwriting to text and set it to keywords for easy searching and indexing.

"Do you guys think that this would be possible? I use OneNote for **a lot** of things and it would be so awesome if SuperNote could sync with them. :-)

I thought of this after my integration with Dropbox completely broke on my A5. Maybe another idea would be to add more slots for quick access? I keep a lot of my notebooks separate and having more than 4 items in the quick access bar would be a gamechanger for me. If this feature comes through Supernote would make an immediate impact on the professionals market (potentially grabbing a chunk of it from iPad). I see OneNote used in the industry a lot, yet very few who use it write up the notes on iPad. In my area we use ordinary notebooks and then retype the notes in OneNote (it is considered unprofessional to type notes in a customer meeting). If I had this sync - that would be the feature I'd be using hte most.  


The key thing though - it should support the corporate sharepoint accounts somehow (OneNote can use sharepoint as the sync backend). Completely agree! None of these devices have that functionality so it would really cater to a very specific target market. Posted this sometime back.  They replied:

"I have had a Supernote A5 for close to two months now, and overall I love it. It has changed the way I work and has made me much more productive.

 However I have been surprised at the poor quality of the images in exported notes. It seems like they export as raster images at the same resolution as the Supernote screen. When I view them on a larger, higher-resolution computer screen the lines look very jagged and pixelated, and zooming in on a note makes this worse (see the attached doodle).

Is there a reason that Supernote does not export to PDF with a vector-based image, like I believe the reMarkable does? I believe this would help the notes look much more legible and clear when read on a computer.

"I wish to use one for home and another for work, but would like both to sync from the same Dropbox account.

I mainly use notes and would like notes to sync on both devices. Interesting question. How do you think the sync should work? My understanding of the sync process is that it doesnt sync unless i explicitly pulldown then top nav bar and hit the sync button.

So, for simplicitly/Minimum Viable Product, i think they should let the end users control sync i.e. if there is a sync conflict (i.e server file updated by another device), they provide the option to a) retain file on device, overwrite on server (cloud) b) retain file on server, overwrite on device. Yes,you can.
And one more thing need to know is that  a6x is trying a new note file format which differently with ""none x"" series(A5,A6). So if you sync one of A5/A6 type with another of A6X type. Each one would fail to open the note file created by another.

"Just got the A6X today and I have to say that as a person who much prefers pen over pencil, it is really nice to write with. I've had the rM1 for about 4 months now and here's my initial thoughts comparing the two. (Background - I'm part designer and researcher and I make things with my hands so I'm very sensitive to the tools I use)

Screen - I thought that the A6X's 300dpi screen would mean that the lines I write would be less pixelated and smoother-looking than the 226dpi of the rM tablet but that's not the case. 

Size - I thought the smaller 7.8"" diagonal screen size would feel like I'm losing out on screen real estate. I don't feel that way because of the finer tip on the pen. The size is more portable than the rM dimensions and I feel like I can take it everywhere with me.

Pen - It's a comfortable weight to write with. The style reminds me of the Pilot Razor Point felt tip pen that I used to use a lot. The finer nib and the feeling that I can press as hard as I need to is mentally relieving. I did not realize how hard I write until I've switched back to pen and paper after using the rM1. The standard rM1 marker feels to me like trying to write with a hollow plastic tube. I also have the LAMY AL-Star and that feels too bulky for my medium-large hand with skinny long fingers. Sometimes when I press the button on it a short line appears out of nowhere on the rM1. I don't have any mods on my rM1.

Writing feel - Wow. Everyone's been saying it's hard to describe. Here's my attempt. My go-to paper for writing is very smooth, about 25% of the way to glossy paper, and I usually use the Muji retractable pen, the one that looks like the Sarasa retractable pen, 0.5mm. It's a ballpoint. Compared to that, writing on the A6X is like if the ballpoint is not rolling, but instead it's gliding. The sound of writing is quieter than the rM, which is quieter than pen on paper. It sounds like you're writing on paper with a smooth paper texture, but that's if you're writing with a light hand. The harder you press down, you'll get less of that scratchy sound. When you first put the pen to the A6X screen, you'll hear a tap sound kind of like Apple Pencil on iPad but quieter. It's louder if you're holding the pen at an angle, and quieter if you're writing on it such that the pen is tangent to the surface (or orthogonal or uhhh straight down for the laymen terms). The rubber texture provides more resistance the harder you press when writing. If you press too hard, it's a lot of friction. But that means that you get more haptic feedback if you're going slow and trying to be precise in your lines. If you're pressing hard and want to write fast, it's gonna feel like too much friction. On that note, I can see the indent of the lines on the screen surface when I write hard and it quickly disappears. So that's good. 

Colors - the A6X has 4 colors. White, light gray, dark gray, and black. I don't see myself using the white one very much. Compared to the rM1 which has white, gray, and black (and light gray for highlighter), this means that I can use the A6X for planning website layouts. Light gray would be content boxes and then darker gray can be non-text content. I would fill in actual content with black. 

Switching between tools - It's nice that it's only one tap to switch to the highlighter or marker(?) on the A6X. On the rM1, this requires two taps and then reading from the list to pick what you want to use. Unless you've got the positions all memorized. For me, this means that it is faster to write headings and highlight important content so that I can structure my notes clearly and visually. 

Interface and some features - It's not as obvious how to get to the Settings menu like on the rM interface. You have to know to swipe down from the top and the mini tutorial at the beginning does not cover that. I love the lasso select text as a heading for a table of contents. That way, I don't have to look through the pages to find what I'm looking for. Compared to the rM1, this means that I will not have to create a new notebook for each topic or subtopic. I can just select the text to be a header. 

Cover - I got the default cover. The front cover feels a bit too lightweight and it wiggles around easily. I can see where the round magnet is on the inside of the front cover, which is not a problem. 

Questions - 

1. I'm trying to sync with Dropbox. There's no new folder on my Dropbox or I can't find it. Do I need to have a Supernote account for this to work? I'm hoping I don't need that. 

2. I'd like to use the nib in a different pen chassis. I was able to unscrew the front piece near the tip but can't seem to get the nib out. Can I even do that with this updated ceramic version?

3. I made a test notebook that's just 2 pages of scribbles. Why is it 2MB? I like that it does tell me how big the file is but I imagine if I have 100 pages, it may be 100MB. So about 2000 pages would be 1GB. So the 22GB of user space I have on the A6X would give me like 44,000 pages. Much less than the rM's advertised 100,000 pages on 8GB. 3. I wrote about the file size as well and the support team replied saying that they will fix that issue in future updates. They said that they are well aware of the issue and they have a potential fix that will be part of one of the future updates. 
Hopefully that future update will be before you reach the 44,000 page limit? Lol just kidding 😅 

Enjoy your A6X, I think its a marvelous tool with an equally amazing &amp; very active team behind it. Cheers. Thanks! Glad they’re going to fix the issue. 

I quite enjoy it so far, much more than I have enjoyed my rM1 in the past months. I think I may have found the right one for me. To read your notes in Dropbox, first export them als pdf or png.

"Had a quick question-what type of charger is recommended for charging my A6X to have better battery life. I read in Onyx Boox posts that fast charging was causing lot of battery issues. 

Is it ok to charge my A6X with a fast charger? Or should it be a small charger? Or a computer perhaps (as the package did come just with a cable and no plug 🔌) 

Want to keep my Supernote for ever 😁 A6X support USBPD (the main fast charge standard). It's a negotiation protocol. When plugged, the charger will ask A6X, ""how much current you want?"", and A6X always answer,""1.5A is enough"". So the charger will start supply current limited by the agreement. You need not worry about too much current would damage the device. Typically A6X will get full charged in 2 hours by a 7.5W (or more powerful) PD charger. 

If you want to use a fast charger, please make sure it's PD type.

It's also ok if you use a computer USB port for charge, it will take more time than PD charger, at about 3-6 hours. Because of computer USB port usually limit the current supply at 0.5A-1A level. Perfect explanation! Thank you",Type of Charger to Use,title prediction
"Hi! Question for the supernote team, after the holidays. 

Are any of the following features on the roadmap? (I understand the hardware roadmap is delayed for bug squashing and UI integration across devices, so it could be a while, but would love to know if they’re at least in the works or in planning.)

1. Frontlight (ability to set brightness at the least, ideally also warmth)
2. Waterproof/water resistant

3. Work with calibre wirelessly* (content server or companion app)


* actually, as I’m still having trouble getting my A5 set up to work with my PC at all via usb cable, I’m not 100% sure it works with the calibre desktop software that way. Does it? If not, that’s definitely a feature request, too.  


Thanks! Our holiday is coming to an end, but I have been on duty during the holiday

1. About the front-light.

When the E Ink screen was first put on the market, it was necessary to add an auxiliary light source due to the low contrast. However, the current contrast gets better and does not require front-light. In products whose main purpose is note-taking, removing the front-light is a common way.

However, some brands with a history of making eReaders continue to use front-light. The reason is that it can be used in places without lights, such as at night. My question is why not turn on the lamp?

Our focus is on a good handwriting experience, writing on a shiny screen will not be an enjoyable experience. 

We use the ""hard pen and soft film"" technology to simulate the effect of paper. If the front-light layer is added, the distance from the pen tip to the display layer will increase. So we would rather give up the front-light feature.

2. About waterproofing

We will not use waterproofing on the ""X"" series (A5X/A6X), but we will consider supporting waterproofing on the successor products of the ""non-X"" series

3. About USB

If you use MAC PC, you need to install the software openMTP to support USB connection. If it's not cause by this, please contact our customer service. Thanks for another quick and thorough reply. I’m consistently impressed by your presence in this subreddit.

1. I sometimes like to work and to read in bed while my spouse is asleep. That said, yes, I could leave the bedroom or perhaps use a smaller external book light. That’s a great point about adding a light lessening the writing experience.

2. Interesting, thanks!

3. It’s a laptop running Windows 10. I’ll do a bit more troubleshooting on my end and then reach out if I still can’t figure it out.

Thank you again. I enjoy this work because I like to communicate with others, especially for interesting idea to make product better. Another reason is I want to improve my English skill since I'm from the place where the mother language isn't English.

I'm happy to learn a new phrase ""reach out"" from your message.

So don't be hesitate to reach out with any question:) &gt;Our focus is on a good handwriting experience, writing on a shiny screen will not be an enjoyable experience.

I totally understand this, but the device can \*also\* be used for reading: and improving the reading experience in low light setting can be nice, don't you think so? It would also improve the perceived contrast of the screen (that's the magic behind the ""paperwhite"").

Eink screens did improve, but the background is still kinda grey. With an optimal lighting and a document with good contrast it's fine, but if that's not the case a frontlight can help. A lot. If it can be shut down, what problem would it create? Is the distance to the display layer so big that the writing experience would be really different?

"My boss was enamored enough of my A6X to buy one for herself, and for her birthday I got her a Heart of Metal pen.  She loves it, so here's a review:

""The pen is STURDY.  I don't feel like the cap is going to pop off if I drop it.  It makes a solid ""click"" when snapping it back on and I love that it's thicker than the standard pen because I prefer writing with wider barreled instruments.  It writes just as perfectly as the standard pen.  No charging required.  I don't know how long the nib will last but the packaging included easy instructions for changing it and I've had the standard for months without any degradation so I don't expect to be changing it any time soon.   Fits snugly on the case's loop and I don't worry about it coming off in my bag."" 

So obviously she gives it 5 stars, lol!  I'll be buying one for myself eventually if I get tired of the LAMY one. Totally agree; I also have the HoM pen, bought it along my A5. It solves the problem I had with my previous eink notepad; as an university student, I write a lot and the nibs would wear off way too fast. Now I can write probably till the end of the world :D So happy.

"I just got both of these delivered today I was in batch 3 for the remarkable 2

Here are my observations as a notebook doodler. I wanted a device that I could take outside and do some sketching and people studies and just generally be able to do rough logo concepts and first stage illustration layouts, like I usually do in my paper notebook. I am a biro scribbler rather than pencils so... here are my observations.

Surface feel - the biggie :) well remarkable has this won hands down. You start drawing on this and you just smile. Man it really does feel and sound like you are drawing on paper. It is absolutely incredible. The supernote definitely doesn’t feel like paper it feels like writing on rubber or a piece of Lino with a biro, as you press harder you can feel the pen almost carving into the surface. It doesn’t feel bad but it definitely doesn’t feel like paper. So if you are just looking for the most realistic paper feel then go get the remarkable 2

Drawing experience - the remarkable 2 has a large range of pens pencils and a brush. The supernote only has three  - fine liner, the pen (pressure sensitive), and the marker. The remarkable brushes all differ in the types of marks that they create and I have not yet found an absolute favourite but the brush seems very versatile lots of variation between thick and thin strokes and the biro mimics it’s real life counterpart rather well. The pencil is ok and uses tilt for shading but for some reason you can only choose one colour (black). 

Due to the smaller selection on the supernote the choice is pretty easy the pen works the best for me due to the pressure sensitivity and mimics fairly well the results that I get when I am sketching with a biro, I usually use lighter (thinner) strokes for initial forms and then lay down harder (thicker) stroke for final forms this technique also works well here. I hope that supernote include more ‘pens’ soon. I would love a brush that lets you lay down thicker strokes to make full use of the pressure sensitivity. The stylus sensitivity and lag on both are very good, perhaps the remarkable edges it here, but the supernote is very very good too.

Colours (greys) - the remarkable includes only three shades for their ‘pens’ - black, mid grey and white - with the exception of the pencil which as mentioned is only available in black. There is also a highlighter which lays down a lighter grey which is handy. It is also worth mentioning that the highlighter is translucent rather than opaque so you can still see your artwork behind it and the colour gets darker as you lay down subsequent strokes (like a real world marker pen) The supernote includes four colours for each tool - black, dark grey, light grey and white, but doesn’t include a translucent highlighter.

Erasing - where the supernote definitely outshines the remarkable 2 is in its erasing capabilities which you wouldn’t think would be a big thing, but it kinda is. I find it very difficult to see the eraser line on the remarkable and you only see what you have erased when you finish your stroke, so you’re never quite sure what the result is going to be, there seems to be quite a bit of trial and error as to how much of the stroke is erased, which is annoying if you are trying to erase precisely for highlights etc. If you are just using one layer then you can ‘erase’ using a white colour for any of the pens, but if you want to put a shadow layer beneath your main artwork then it kinda messes everything up because you have white opaque ink on the layer above. Supernote on the other hand nails this, the eraser works the same as the brushes, it erases instantly so you can be very precise. Obviously in real life you don’t have multiple layers in your paper notebook but thought it was worth mentioning.

Screen refresh - the remarkable leaves quite noticeable ghosting behind on darker inked areas when you close the tool sub palettes, and I don’t think it’s possible to do a manual screen refresh, although switching a layer visibility off and on seems to do the trick. I haven’t encountered these issues on the supernote but if I did you can swipe up on the sidebar to refresh the screen which is nice.

Size and portability - the remarkable is about the same size as an A4 piece of paper. So the equivalent of an open a5 notepad which is what I usually have in front of me in front of my keyboard when I’m working, so it’s a nice size, to scribble down some sketches or client notes when at work. The supernote may be a little small to jot down a lot of notes or sketches and it is not currently possible to zoom in to the canvas, but is absolutely ideal to pop in your bag and do some al fresco doodling. Another thing to note is that the remarkable 2 has a landscape mode but the supernote doesn’t. So if you are drawing in landscape orientation the toolbar is rotated 90 degrees

Overall feel - I preordered my remarkable 2 and just got the vanilla options so standard pen and sleeve only. So that cost around USD399 plus shipping The supernote a6x was USD 369 plus shipping but the real kick in the pants was the 20% extra you pay on import taxes. So these two devices were practically the same price. 

But when you handle them the remarkable feels like a luxury item and the supernote feels like a fun friendly gadget. I wouldn’t think twice about throwing the supernote in my bag and whipping it out to do some urban sketching, but the remarkable 2 feels a lot more precious and feels like it would be a lot more conspicuous in public places

From a pure sketching point of view it’s difficult to choose between the two. The pen performance on both is equally as good. The sheer size and paper feel make the remarkable great for cracking out development sketches and making  longer form notes at home or the office. The only thing putting a dampener on the experience is the eraser functionality. The size of the supernote makes it very portable and great for urban sketching, single sketches, and shorter notes/lists.

I’m enjoying them both and not sure which will get most use but I have a feeling that I’ll take the supernote everywhere with me, and use the remarkable primarily at my desk or on the sofa.

In summary

Remarkable 2

===========

\+ feels like writing on paper

\+ Premium feeling/looking product

\+ Pen performance is great

\+ Landscape mode

Eraser isn’t very good

Some screen refresh artefacts

Maybe a little conspicuous for urban sketching

Supernote a6x

===========

\+ Great size for urban sketching

\+ Free folio cover and pen

\+ Pen performance is great

\+ More shades of grey to choose from

\+ Eraser works well

Feels like biro on rubber not paper

Fewer tool to choose from

No zoom

No landscape mode

Maybe too small for development sketches or extensive notes

Hope that helps any doodlers out there Thank you for bringing a so fair and so detailed comparison.

After I read it carefully, I will follow your article from the role of product participant. This is such a great review. Very detailed. I especially agree with you on the size of the A6x. I find myself bringing it everywhere with me because of its size. Great review!

Another point I notice about the Supernote. The bottom end of the pressure curve has no opacity pressure. Only size. So the stroke gets smaller, and then just stops at a certain pressure activation.

On Remarkable, a light touch with the pen has a slight opacity falloff, like a real pen. The pencil even more so. So you can get a lighter half-textured stroke.

But even the Remarkable pen pressure curve doesn’t go to zero. It snaps off at a certain pressure. So if you try and draw an extremely light line, it snaps on and off like a dashed line.

I’d love if both these tablets had a complete drop off to zero on the pressure curve. It would make drawing much better. But with Remarkable, it has a slight edge because it has a bit of opacity falloff too.

Both feel nice though, and I enjoy drawing and writing on both.

Also, sometimes I use the Remarkable stylus on the Supernote. The plastic nib glides very nicely over the rubbery surface! And the stylus is lighter than the Heart of Metal stylus, so it’s a bit easier on my wrist after a while.  Supernote was originally designed for note-taking, so we made HoM into the same shape and weight as a traditional pen.

But when it comes to art, the lighter the better. So we're going to make a special pencil for the artist. It can also be used in other situations. And compatible with all Supernote tablets. This pen will be the default accessory for A5 SLIM, but users can purchase it separately.

"I haven't ordered an A6X yet,  was really hoping for an A5X soon.  I was wondering it anyone is able to test the Trello app for functionality and if it doesn't work is life to put in s request for it. Hello, thank you for your information, we have recorded your request. Could you please describe your use case? I am an engineering consultant. I create buckets for each of my clients and then create cards for each project I'm working on. Inside the cards I add notes from calls, task lists, setup a timeline that gets added to a calendar, etc. Once a project is done I will move the card to Client-Archive bucket. I would suggest you look at getting a regular tablet, like an iPad with a paperly screen protector instead to get a paper-like feel. I don't think this device or other eInk devices can properly support that work flow.

If you want just a Kanban board I'd understand. You could definitely draw up a Kanban template. But a fully functional Trello is excessive for these types of devices. 

Additionally, Trello doesn't support handwriting, so you would be typing everything out anyways, which will be a way slower experience due to eInk. 

Take Onyx Boox for example. They just use fully open android so you can install anything you want. But the performance of the app won't be any good for it. Since they have no control over a third party-apps, nothing can be done other than wait for an upgraded model that can handle it.

"After updating to the most recent A5 software here are some of my thoughts about the changes made to the top menu bar for note taking.

Moving the page number display position in notes to the top menu bar to prevent accidental touches was a definite improvement for my daily workflow. However I feel that the user interface design of the top menu bar still needs a bit more refinement, as I have now lost easy access to a lot of my regularly used menu items such as share &amp; export, templates, and quick access.

I think too much unnecessary space is being taken up by the note/document title (50% or more of the screen width) and the page navigation. By reducing the size of the space and decreasing the font size of the text for the titles, I think at least 3 or 4 of the other more commonly used menu items can be restored to the primary top menu instead of being relegated to the secondary drop down menu list instead.

Curious to know others opinions on the new top menu redesign for the A5. Which menu items do you often use that are now part of the secondary menu options (ooo)? 

Is there any way to customise which menu items are more important for inclusion in the primary top menu by prioritising the items in the same way that tag menu items are ordered in the settings menu?

As always thanks for the regular updates and feedback on questions and issues posted by users. Malcsweb, have you tried to simply double tap anywhere on the screen to hide all menus?  This gives you full screen real a state for writing or document viewing. Thanks but the issue is not about trying to hide menus for writing/reading but suggesting to get rid of empty white space in the title and page navigation section of the NEW top menu to make room for more menu options that used to be there previously. Thank you for your thoughts, this is very helpful. What do you think about the user interaction design of the A6 X? We have piloted a new user interface on the A6 X. The top menu has been redesigned based on the frequency with which users access different menu items. We are still working on this interface and plan to unify the A5, A6 Agile and A6 X once it is complete. Thanks Supernote\_official. Haven't seen the A6X design in detail but from what you described I like the idea of top menu items based on frequency of use. Look forward to seeing this feature in future updates.

1. I have never used the Kindle app before and I don t quite understand it.

I also find out that you can buy kindle books for 3rd party shops. I am not interested in the market aspect of it, because there are not many books in my language on their platform, but is there a reason to choose the kindle library over the default Supernote library (the tablet's interface itself)?

2. I just found out about the titling feature of the tablet, but can I use it for PDF s text (lasso -&gt; transform into title)? If not, how could I insert titles that could be recognized by the tablet if we are talking about a PDF that I created? 

3. Because I didn t find a solution to the .2 question, I am using bookmarks. Can i change the ""title"" of the bookmark? Long press doesn t work.

4. I just saw that .word format is available (I don t know if it was available before) and that a lot of functions were implemented for it, especially the zoom function. I was quite sad that I can t zoom in my PDFs, but I found out about the trimming feature for the PDFs files. This is like a zoom, right? Does it have another function?

1. kindle app is used to read the ebooks only from kindle store. 

2. We support the handwriting title to make the note file structured and indexable. because many user's note increased to dozens of pages, they need a easy way locate the page quickly. We will not support this feature on PDF/DOC. Because PDF/DOC has own methods such as cross-reference, you can jump to the page from the cross-reference.

"Just following up with a question I saw someone else had. A major use case for me to buy into an e-ink note taking device is to be able to skip a step when taking notes. The conversion of my handwritten notes to text that I can eventually turn into more coherent documents. Is handwriting to text in the pipeline for implementation? It's a fashion. But according to our test, handwriting recognition will limit the fun and freedom of notes, and even slow down the writing speed (in order to ensure the recognition rate). So we will support this feature, but the priority is not high. And handwriting recognition will first be applied in some partial features, such as keyword recognition, and the text insertion in the doc revision function that will be released in the next update. The function of ""entire handwriting recognition and import into DOC/TXT"" will be implemented at the end.

This is not a technical problem, but a difference in product concepts. That's good to know it is something that can be implemented. Thank you for actually responding, even if I am disappointed in the answer.

But wouldn't that improve the functionality and fun of a note taking device? I don't think it has to be done simultaneously, but if I'm using the supernote  to take notes during an interview, a meeting, or a lecture, which seems like a pretty common use-case, it would so helpful to be able to export my handwritten notes afterwards into a text document. I don't think it has to be live. It could even be something you schedule to do when the device isn't being used. It would add a practical element to something that is fun! 

For example. As part of an ideation process, I could be brainstorming something on my device, have it exported to an md, docx, or txt file, share with a colleague for feedback, and then I could review/annotate it back on my device. It would just eliminate a step of doing a manual conversion!

If it isn't a technical problem, you could implement it in a way that fits with your intentions for the devices. But if Nova and other note-taking eink/tablet can do it, its a bit unfortunate this one chooses not to. Especially when your devices seem to offer such good features in other ways! It seems like the devices are so close to what I want, and I may still buy one, but not having this available in the foreseeable future is a reason not to jump in, yet.

Either way, thanks again for replying and being transparent, even if I don't agree. Until I can justify a device, I wish the team continued success! If you output TXT/DOC in a calm environment, you will find the keyboard is the most efficient.  If you take notes in interviews or meetings, you will find that your writing needs to keep up with other people's speeches, which leads to scribbling.  Some sketches are even mixed in to make the description more intuitive.  These all increase the difficulty of identification.  If you have really used similar software, you will find that the effect may not be as good as you think.  We are not opposed to full text recognition.  We just tend to accumulate some assistive technology and then do this.  For example, how to distinguish between sketches and characters. Because once we start to do this, we must ensure that it is really effective, not just a marketing video in an ideal state. Yes indeed a keyboard would be more efficient, but for many reasons, not always viable. Hence a note-taking device can fill the need. It's good point that hand notes tend to also include sketches or special characters, like those in mathematical equations or flow charts or cluster maps. It is reassuring that it seems that there is a focus on delivering a clever bit of software as the goal. However, you did say earlier that it wasn't technically difficult. So now I'm confused.

Either way, it seems this functionality will be added, perhaps more in the future, but when it does, I think your software and products will become a lot more attractive to people like me, or academics, analysts, jotters, or creatives. The original point of my question was whether it was in the roadmap of functionality. I'm glad to see it is, disappointed it isn't as much of a priority, so now I'm hoping that when it does become a feature, that it was worth the wait",Handwriting to text,title prediction
"Hello guys! I'm wondering if A6X can handle pdfs (scanned books) well. I'm a bit worried about the screen size. I heard there's crop function but is that enough to read small texts?

How's your experience?

(p.s. eagerly waiting for the A5X) I am reading now on some material that I wrote in Times New Roman 12, double spaced, and with the crop function it s good. It was readable even without the crop function (I discovered it later).

The only part that I don t like about the crop function is the fact that it takes the ""note space"" away, but I believe you can ""\[ \]"" and make notes inside that - look into the user manual for this. 0:46 - PDF articles.

"It would be wonderful to be able to borrow free ebooks from my public library right from A5. I know other linux based e-reader devices can do this, e.g. Kobo.  I wonder if other A5 users would like this feature?  And....Is there any chance that Ratta engineers can integrate Overdrive or Libby into the A5 platform. OverDrive seems only support  ios/android. So you may get other resource, such as gutenberg project.  [https://www.gutenberg.org/](https://www.gutenberg.org/)  You may download the ebooks from the website and than transfer to your A5. Thank you hex2asc.  I appreciate your prompt reply.  I will try this.  

But, please allow me to ask another question.  I am not a programmer, so my knowledge is very limited in this area.  And I probably don’t know that I don’t know.   Nevertheless, when I was researching e-ink tablets, I selected the A5 because of the stability of Linux OS, which runs my wonderful A5.  I understand that Kobo e-readers also run on Linux.  How can they incorporate Overdrive, and not the A5 if hey are both on the same platform?  Is it because e-readers are fundamentally different from e-ink tablets? You like to ask why, which makes me have to check the usage of OverDrive.

I found that Kobo has developed an interface specifically for OverDrive, so Kobo can directly connect to OverDrive to browse and read eBooks. But for other eReaders, there will be some complexity, Users need to install the software ADE (Adobe Digital Editions) on PC/Mac . We can to vist the OverDrive website by PC browser, and then download the eBook, and then transfer the book to the e-reader.

We have not tried to connect to ADE,  we will learn more and try. I am grateful that you looked into it and even considering the request.  Best wishes.",Feature request: Overdrive on the the Linux A5 platform.,title prediction
"Is A6X more abrasive than Oynx on the pen? If I use the same pen (Lamy Al Star) on both of them, will the nib wear be the same? I am not sure about the nib wear, but i believe the nib you would use on both devices are different. Due to the surface coating on the A6X, the nib is harder compare to the nib you would use for Onyx.  


So if you do reuse a pen between the two devices, you would have to swap nibs before using. Thanks for the answer. Is it possible just to buy the nib for A6X from somewhere? Supernote devices have a built in screen protector that is much more pliable than Onyx (or any other e ink device).  The pen that comes with Supernote devices has a ceramic tip that never needs to be replaced.  It can only be used with Supernote devices - if you use it on any other type of device it will scratch the surface.

You can also get an upgraded package from Supernote that includes a Lamy Al Star EMR.  The nib on that is plastic and will need to be replaced.  Because the Supernote screen is more pliable than other devices, it's possible that nibs will last longer when used on that device versus other ones.

I purchased the A6X with the stock pen (ceramic nib) and it works great.  I also have a Lamy - but I use reMarkable nibs in it.  The stock Lamy nib on the Supernote felt too slippery.  The reMarkable nibs work great and have a better writing feel in my opinion.

I also have the Noris Digital Jumbo, and absolutely love the writing feel of that on the A6X.  I usually switch between the Noris and Lamy because I love both of them.

Based on a recent video from Voja ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgj5Y7NHY74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgj5Y7NHY74)) about the best pen and nib combinations for e ink devices, I have ordered the Samsung Tab S6 Lite pen and  HP ZBOOK X2 nibs.  Can't wait for those to come in.  On a side note, I also can't wait to order an A5X :D I had an Onyx Boox Max 3 and sent it back. Now I have a Supernote A6X. The A6X is far better than the Max 3 for the writing feel with the Lamy pen (with lamy standard nibs). The Supernote Pen is better than the Boox pen too.

"I use the Scribd app for ebooks and audiobooks. It is a service that is dying for an ereader but alas there isn't one. A partnership between Scribd and Supernote would be innovative! Copy that. Partnerships are both good and bad. How many devices do we  buy with preloaded applications we never wanted and can never get rid of? 

Is okay to offer it, but also allow the customer to delete it. The last thing Supernote needs is a application to Scribd that can never be removed by the customer.

Example, I dislike Facebook and never use it. But I can't uninstall it from my Samsung Note 9. I can turn it off, but it's always there. Very good points, I totally agree. I agree. I like the Kindle app on Supernote A6X - it works great on the e-ink screen and provides an option to read purchased books on an already excellent note taking device.

Having Scribd would provide a 'Netflix for books' like option to supplement Kindle's traditional book buying option and, for me, would complete the e-ink device experience.

I agree with another poster that too many apps would be cumbersome and detract from Supernote's streamlined user experience. If someone wants unlimited flexibility to download apps, Likebook and Onyx are options. I'm happy they picked Kindle and stuck with it instead of adding Kobo and Play Books and all the other alternatives. (I'd similarly be fine if they had picked a different store front - too many choices weigh down the user interface. Better to have one and stick with it.)

"Would it be possible to have a tools menu accessible in full screen mode? I like full screen for writing, but it is annoying to have to exit full screen to pull up the tool bar. Yes, a floating tool bar/bubble is comming in near update. Any chance of getting the A5 functionality of double tapping to go in and out of full screen? In the early design, we used a lot of hidden interactive functions. For example, double-click to enter/exit the full screen. Swipe from the side to the center of the screen to call the writing toolbar. Long press the file name to enter file delete/move/copy operations, etc. These designs make the interface more concise, but also cause some side effects. Most users will not read the user manual carefully (of course I do too), and they will complain if they don't know what to do. So in the later design, we try to avoid hiding functions, but it may be overkill.

" I know the Ratta team has a lot on their plates but hopefully this is something that can  be addressed in future software updates. I think both the rM and Supernote look as unclean as they do because of how note-taking on the devices themselves is the main selling point, and so to the creators of these eNote devices, export comes after that. Not saying that the exports should not look crisp, but it bears repeating what the primary intention of each device is to help understand where these young products stand. As for whether or not they're dealbreakers is up to the consumer.

In addition, Onyx Boox products tend to be somewhere in-between eNote and a full-blown eInk Android device, which is why they have the best of both worlds for software.

"After searching high and low, did you know, not a single note taking device or application offers hand recognition spelling checking. Not a single one.

If the device or application can do OCR for hand writing, then it could also spell check too. Normally OCR keeps some index of the words written to search against. That index could also be scanned against a dictionary. If the word is not found in the dictionary, the device or application could highlight or tag the word as misspelled. It's up to the developers of the tool offers spelling options or corrections.

I've put the same challenge to Goodnotes application team for the iPad. As I said, no one offers this feature yet. 

So depending if Supernote or Goodnotes implements first, then that's what I'm going with. My needs are simple, OCR for text search and spell checking. I posted before I finished. For OCR the possibilities really multiply. With standard text you can offer translation services.

Also, some people love writing notes, but they don't like their handwriting. So if you introduced OCR with font replacement, you can help those folks make beautiful notes. Write a word, and OCR picks up the word, and then replaces the word with nice font

Ratta might think of selling add-ons too. So everything I mentioned could be an additional extra folks could buy /unlock. No different that Goodnotes / Notability or other note taking apps.

If the difference between having full OCR with search and spelling check is extra $40, then that is worth it to me.

I hate subscriptions though. Have you checked out MyScript Nebo? I use it for long form writing (just straight up writing text, no drawings). It's on android and iOS and can convert your handwriting to text as you write. Just double-tap to convert. And it's easy to edit the text that's already been converted. Your handwriting style does not get saved. 

It can then export the text to different formats or other apps. I like to use it with Day One which is awesome for journaling. 

Doing long form writing on the Supernote feels like a lot of handwritten text that I have to review and type out if I want to make any good use of it. We have 3 goals

1 Make the note orgnized by original handwriting titles that can help user locate the page quickly. like ""table of contents"" of MS DocX.  Without any recognition. This is more free, you can set anything as titile, words, symbols,etc...

2 Can modify the DocX by handwriting. 

3 Can recogination entie page of handwring smartly(Able to distinguish between text and sketches) and output to Text/MarkDown/DocX.

"I was wondering if Supernote has any plans to support RemNote in X series (as RemNote is available as an android app) (see \[1\] below for further details on RemNote).

I think it would be quite useful to have an advanced note-management app (like RemNote, Obsidian, Roam research, Insight, etc) available in supernote directly; among these, RemNote is free and has an android app (btw I'm not affiliated with RemNote or anything, I just find it extremely efficient. See \[2\] for my use case).

I'm not sure whether this is a niche use case or whether there are a lot of supernote esers who would use this if it was available, so I'd appreciate if the community chimes in. Also, I'm tagging u/hex2asc : I'd appreciate if the Chief Chat Officer informs us to if there is any such plan :)  
\------

\[1\] For those who do not know, RemNote is a ""note-taking"" platform/app. It uses science-backed methods to ensure efficient learning (such as spaced-repetition, bi-directional linking, flashcards, etc).   Please see [https://www.remnote.io](https://www.remnote.io) for further details. There are several such platforms (RemNote in my opinion is most balakned, and is also free), for a nice comparison see these youtube videos [https://youtu.be/M2U61vHfQSQ](https://youtu.be/M2U61vHfQSQ) , [https://youtu.be/opSENgc45Sw](https://youtu.be/opSENgc45Sw) .

\[2\] I'm a PhD student in physics, and I use RemNote regularly to take both my academic notes and my daily scribbles . I  do not own a supernote right now, but I'll be buying a5x ---actually I would buy it right now while it is discounted but unfortunately I'm currently not in US and will not be back till the end of next month. I plan to use supernote to read papers (mostly arxiv stuff). I would definitely use this if it were available. I am not sure how feasible it would be though without the addition of an external keyboard. Part of the beauty of Remnote is how quickly one can enter and arrange data with keyboard shortcuts. But maybe I'm just too used to using it on my laptop to envision a new implementation.

Now, if only there were a way to have all of Remnote's features in a handwriting app then I would be in pure bliss. 🤗 I have to admin that I don't know RemNote or similar types of tools.  
My question here is how much RemNote needs web connection and ""intelligence"" from other places to organize/restructure information.

I think one of the main positive features of Supernote is that is focused on note taking, it can be used offline and you can choose when you need to go online or USB-connect to transfer/synchronise your stuff.  
To be too much dependent on external engines or tools (if this is something RemNOte requires) is not something I see as a positive path for Supernote, but of course this is a personal and quite limited point of view from myself :-) The poor CCO does not know much.

"Hi, I see with pleasure that Supernote is working hard to support editing functionalities for digital formats (i.e. Word .docx).

I have to admit that I'm not using them a lot now, but I'd like to ask here why the .docx format and if Supernote is planning to have a more general and standard approach to this.

Word is a proprietary tool and .docx is a not-so-great standard for text document (I don't use MSOffice and I use the standard .odt format, supported by LibreOffice, OpenOffice... for text documents).

What I'm thinking is whether simpler plain text formats could be supported as a more standard and interoperable basis to transform digital notes.  
I think that simple .txt files would be the first step, but an open and widely implemented and supported structured text format as Markdown ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)) would be an ideal solution.

I can see (dreaming) simple signs (short line or asterisks) for writing bullet points or identifying headers in the notes or ways to reference other notes (internal links). You already have some functions transforming manual input into structured commands (e.g. the square brackets or the stars for notes, the insert or flip command in the Word files) so it seems to me a natural evolution for more advanced functions.

I think that having a plain text format like Markdown supported could allow to have multiple types of export from it (.docx, .odt, .rst, simple .txt) and it can be well connected also with (future implementations of?) text recognition and transformation from manual notes to structured text.

Anyway, this is just food for thought... :-)

Ale I would personally love that feature! I do remember reading on this reddit that Mzrkdown support is planned. Text and MarkDown will be support. It’s in plan.

I find them both very comfortable to hold. The Lamy might be better for controlling the pen when trying to do precise work and it's lighter than the Heart of Metal. However, it probably comes down to personal preference. If you have access to a regular Lamy pen, the experience will be similar if you want to test it against a typical metal executive type pen that the Heart of Metal emulates.

The ceramic nib on the new Heart of Metal pens ensures that you won't have to worry about replacing nibs as they wear out. 

Personally, I like them both and alternate between them. The Lamy will also work on other EMR enabled screens like some Chromebooks and tablets. The ceramic nib on the Heart of Metal is hard so shouldn't be used with a device other than the supernote.

If you do a fair bit of drawing, then the Lamy might be the better pick. If you mostly take notes, I think that the Heart of Metal has the overall edge. I watched your guide and thought it was very good. I've watched many of your in-depth reviews and rely on them for choosing e-ink devices.

I would comment that I was surprised at the lower rating for Precision that you gave the Lamy (7/10) - not a bad rating - but in my experience, I found its precision to be very good and more comparable to the top of the group.

I was also surprised at the higher rating for the Samsung. It's a better pen than the standard Boox, but I didn't see it as anything special - too thin for my taste, round unlike the Staedler, and I didn't like the feel of the soft nib at all.

Otherwise, I agree with your ratings. 

Thanks for the guide! Thank you! You've been very helpful!",Difference between AL-star EMR and the other styluses,title prediction
"Hello all
I just figured out some of the basic yet powerful features needed on the the Supernote devices.

The pdf experience on the supernote is not bad, but some of  functionalities on it would make it great for any kind of document format...

1. Landscape mode for pdf documents.
2. Crop Features including the article mode support 
3. Gesture for bringing up the table of contents.
4. Insert clipart / image while taking notes.
5. Pinch to zoom in and out the content.

These features would make even the smaller A6x fully functional.

2. I will forward it to PM.
3. In kindle device, we can tap the top area to call the TOC. But in Supernote, we must filter the tap when writing. So can we call the TOC from sidebar?
4. In plan, but not start
5. Is developing. Awesome...
Thank you for the kind response
Really love the device and the writing feel on it
But yeah some times I feel adding functionalities would make the device even more better...

Looks like a lot of new features are on the map and really looking forward to see them on my A6X.

Reg.2 I mean TOC while reading pdf textbooks and not on the notes app.
And yeah if it is possible to call the TOC through the sidebar it would be handy and neat.
I have some ideas but not sure if it is possible to implement them on the device.
1. In a document -&gt; In the full screen mode (I mean *only when double tapped on a document to get rid of all the UI elements) - the sidebar when swiped up  instead of showing the regular app navigation menus it would be great if it shows TOC and as uasual manual refresh when swiped down. 
On exit (I mean again double tap) brings everything to the normal way as usual as it is at the moment...
(OR)
Atleast an option to manually set what the swipe up side bar does in which TOC is an option.

2. Two finger swipe on screen from left to right to bring up the TOC in a box covering half the screen is also an option...",Manditory Functionalities needed on the Supernote devices,title prediction
"I really like how responsive and supportive the Supernote team is, especially on Reddit. It's great to see they consider the user experience and feedback. A little while ago someone posted something and a rep from the team made a comment like 'we hadn't thought of that, it's an interesting idea'. I think this type of feedback system is great!

However, I feel a lot of people post on this sub with a kind of 'all or nothing' slant - like if 'Supernote doesn't do X, then I'm not buying!' It""s fine, it's a forum, it's up to you to make your line in the sand somewhere. But, why are some people writing so absolutely? I think if we have feedback or suggestions, it would probably be most effective written with examples or justification or use-case scenarios. I know I'd be more inclined to listen to well-explained ideas rather than ultimatums. 

Alas, just some boxing day venting. Cheers y'all You should see r/remarkabletablet if you think this is bad... Not comparable.
Remarkable support does not respond, it is normal that ppl go absolute in that case. Supernote read every single line and answers.
The point is not ""it is bad"", the point is ""it has no sense to write with this tone."", as far as I understand. Yeah, in general I agree. A lot of people are kinda taking the teams responsiveness for granted.

Here are just a few examples:  

* ""I've put the same challenge to Goodnotes application team..."" ""My needs are simple""
* ""Mandatory functionalities needed""
* ""Why are you not supporting""

As much as I love the teams responsiveness, I do feel some people have been quite harsh in their wording when making requests.

Personally I'd rather the team improve what they already have, before adding more work to their plate and bloating the system. I've always seen Supernote to be a minimalist alternative to other devices simply for ""note-taking"".

I guess some people want stuff with all the bells &amp; whistles like:

* E-reader with pdfs, news, books, and probably even websites.
* E-writer with every single text format.

Which is pretty much the Onyx Boox. Which is not minimalist or lightweight. I'd personally rather a tool that does one job, and one job well. To jump off of the last sentence:

As useful as the kindle update is, I'm very excited for the improvements they're making with their native writing software (e.g. pencil brush and Word editing). They're consistently refining the ""mobile office"" idea with each update, and I'm glad to see that they take the time to put in additional stuff but only as secondary or supportive of the ""mobile office"" theme. Hopefully in the next update or the one after it, they have some improvements for the native pdf reader for markup and export.

"I had my A6x for a few months now, but today was the first time I had to transfer some files to it from my phone.  I tried to pair it, but I keep getting nowhere.  I tried initiating pairing from the phone and A6x with same results.

Basically the two devices see each other, both pop up a pin screen and both have a pair button.  When I click pair button on A6x a keyboard pops up, which I assume is to enter the pin.  When I enter the pin it kicks me back out of the bluetooth settings screen. The two appear to be briefly connected, but then connection is lost.  Any clue what's going on.

If it matters I have a Google Pixel 4 that works fine with my other bluetooth devices. We think that the Bluetooth transmission rate is low, so we did not use it to transfer files. And only use it to support Bluetooth keyboards and Bluetooth speakers. It will failed to connect to other devices. But we should give tips for other connections that are not supported. Clear information should be given instead of letting users guess what happened. This is our mistake. We will fix it as soon as possible.

If you transfer files from a mobile phone, it is recommended to use cloud synchronization. You can use Supernote Cloud or Dropbox. You can also use Wifi-Direct to transmit directly (it needs to be on the same WIFI network, sometimes it is not stable). Both of these methods require you to install the Supernote Parter App or Dropbox App on your phone. Is there any update on the super note app not functioning for the last few months?

1) How long does it take to ship? I live in California.

2) Is there a desktop app? If so, can I create a note in the desktop app or is it simply importing/exporting? The reason I ask is because my work prevents me from using cloud services due to security reasons. I was hoping I could import screenshots from my work computer and place it in a note on the A6X via USB.

3) How frequent are you guys recharging your device?

TIA!! Hello.

1. About the ship... It took me 7 days aprox to come to Spain. But I paid €150 of taxes...
2. Nope. Only the Browser version of supernote's app. But you can configure dropbox. The only problem is you cannot see notes in dropbox. You must export first to PDF or JPG from your A6X.
3. It depends, it can last 1 week if you use it for hours. For me is about 2 - 3 weeks of light use because I'm not that busy right now.

Anytime! 1) West Coast here. Bought it on Christmas, got shipped on the 28th, and received it on the 31st. So 3 or 6 days, depending on how you measure it.

3) I charged it once in the time I've had it, though it's about to need another one. 2. I find even though I sync to Dropbox, I don’t review my notes on devices other than the Supernote itself.

"Hi! A very happy user of A6X here. I had a feature request. 

Currently the name of a new note is basically the timestamp without spaces. I do want dates as the name of the notes, but I would like the option to make it more readable so I don't have to change it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason and explanation:

* I find using the keyboard and renaming a notes doc every time I create one tedious, and the current timestamp one is not as readable
* Mostly I end up just adding spaces/dashes to make it more like yyyy-MM-dd-timstamp format, so would be great if say the device could give option what the default name is. 
   * Some options could be
      * yyyy-MM-dd &lt;day of week&gt; i.e. 2021-01-05 Tuesday
      * yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss i.e. 2021-01-05 12:00:00
      * yyyy MMM dd i.e. 2021 Jan 05
      * and many more
   * In case of duplicates, the notes can always append (count) to differentiate. Eg: ""2021-01-05 (1)"" if another file with the same name exists After seeing your suggestion, I immediately understood why I always thought the default file name was strange before.

"Hey... Just ordered A5X and have a few questions.

I have a sizeable Zotero library 6000+ pdfs that I currently sync to my BOOX via Google drive and an app (autosync). This works pretty well as Zotero automatically names the pdf files with author-year-title, and search is quick enough on BOOX to bring up the thing I need in a couple of seconds. I can then annotate and save, the annotated version gets automatically synced back to my laptop.

What I want to know is - does dropbox sync on Supernote automatically keep in sync? How well will Supernote handle that many PDFs in terms of search speed? And, will annotations be backed up straight to Dropbox/laptop?

Cheers! How are you using Zotero as a pdf library? :O Annotations are backed up to drop box as a separate .mark file. So you’ll have the original unedited .pdf, plus a .mark with annotations. 

You have to export or use the supernote companion app if you want new pdfs that have the annotations integrated. Zotero works really well to organise pdfs - you can drag/drop a pdf onto the main window and it will usually find the metadata for it (better than other reference managers I've used). The trick for getting pdfs easily available on mobile is to use the extension 'zotfile' which will rename the pdf and move it from Zotero's own labyrinth directory structure into one big directory that you can sync with Google Drive/Dropbox. Also, the browser addon for Zotero is great for taking html snapshots of webpages - these come out really well on Boox devices (I don't know about other ereaders) as text-resizable books.

The annoyance on Boox (as with Android tablets/phones) is there is no way to push changes to the Google drive folder to the device, so you have to use a third party app that you manually sync or set it to look at time intervals. This works, but just not very efficient.

There is an android app - zoo for zotero - that's really well made and can link to the synced folder to open pdf attachments. The problem is that when you have a lot of pdfs it can be very slow to open the pdf. Maybe down the line a version for Supernote could be great. Ah, thanks for the info. That should work fine for my needs. In some ways it is better to keep the version in my Zotero library clean from my scribbles anyway and it is good to have a separate place for marked up versions to know what's been read, maybe.","Zotero, Dropbox sync and search capabilities A5X",title prediction

an Idea I had, since kindle is its own aplication would be adding a small memo pad on the top pull down menu, that way taking quick notes from kindle (or any future apps might be possible) within the app. I dont know how feasible it is to make the app and note function work at the same time.

another thing I was thinking which I dont know if it is already a setting or not since I could not find it, is displaying the residence or contact info at the lock screen, in the case the tablet gets lost.

currently If I loose my device, whoever finds it would need to unlock it, go to the menu, find account information and then contact me.

"Hi Supernoters, I have a question.  

I am on the A5.  I have a note page that I use to document and track my billable hours for consulting services.  For ease of documentation of my consulting hours, I linked this page under [Quick access].  That note file now is now 37 pages long, and grows weekly.  Every time I go to [Quick access] and open this this note file, it opens by default to the first page.  I then have to jump to the last page to add new hours.  Is there a way to have Supernote to open (by default) the last page that was opened?  Has someone found a workaround?  If not, then can the last paged opened in a note page be the default when accessing a note file from [Quick access]?

Thanks Tats a neat idea. Could definitely see how that is useful. On drawboard there is a little symbol that lets you jump back to the start of the previous  'timestamp' like when you first started a chapter or something. It would be cool to have Great suggestion.

"Hello Supernote,

I’ve pre-ordered the 5x and am excited to start using it!  I’ve been watching videos on it and noticed you changed the ‘create’ button so that instead of instantly creating a new note, you now have to choose whether you want to add a note or a Word document. 

I think many of us will rarely (if ever) create a Word document as we have purchased this device primarily for making hand written notes. 

Can you please either move the Word document creation to another location, or only show that option after a long tap-and-hold, etc. so that a regular tap on the ‘plus’ icon will simply create a note?

I plan to create dozens of notes per day so this would make the experience much more pleasant. 

Thanks for considering. Agreed Your suggestion make sense. We will change it soon.

Thank you very much. Thanks very much! Agreed too!! I dont really need the word document creation function so readily. Perhaps place that option in the document folder? Thanks so much to the supernote team! I feel theyve been so innovative :)",Return to single-tap note creation,title prediction
"Hi everyone,

1.  I saw something posted here a while ago about choosing a server, but I can no longer find it.  I created my account on the Supernote A5x and enabled sync.  Upon logging into the cloud in my browser I accidentally clicked the China location, not realizing I couldnt switch afterwards.  Is there any way to switch server location after the fact?  Is there an option on the physical device I may not be seeing?

2.  I was testing things out, creating notes and playing around with the features.  I hit the sync button to upload what I have, went to the server website, and all I can see are the folders Ive created.  No notes show up at all, only the one screenshot I took.  Any information on this?

3.  Is there an export/save as pdf option yet?  I saw the post from a while back that it was coming but I havent seen any updates on it so far.

Thanks in advance for any help! Re. 1, paging /u/hex2asc.

For 2, have you actually selected the folders you want to sync? It doesn't default to syncing anything and might just be showing you a skeleton directory structure.

For 3, hit the 3 dots -&gt; Export -&gt; PDF, or do you mean proper vector export? For 2.  How do I select which folders to sync?  Long press, check them, then hit sync from the drop down?

3.  I figured that one out, just what I needed it to do.  Edited my original post.

Thank you for your help! So you need to go back into settings, go into sync, and click the right arrow to choose folders. You can choose a folder by checking it or enter the folder by tapping it (say you only want to sync a subdirectory -- as an example, I sync a directory called Personal but not Work).

If the folder chooser doesn't show up, it's a software glitch -- rebooting (in the settings too) will fix it. I see the arrow, and all of my folders are checked off",Questions about syncing and other things.,title prediction

"Hey, so I'm upgrading my trusty old kindle keyboard ereader and I really really like the look of the supernote devices. They just look much nicer than boox in my opinion. I love the aesthetic, the nicer pens, the nicer cases etc.

One of the huge reasons to upgrade my old kindle is to get a Glow light. At the moment I use a clip on light that is a faff. I know supernote devices currently don't have lights but will they in the future? Is it worth me waiting to see if they get one?

My second question is will super note support apps/apks so I can borrow books from my local library? Here in the UK most library's use BorrowBox which has an Android app. The second most popular library app is Libby. Will Supernote make these two apps available?

Thanks Very much doubt they'll ever have a light, it requires more space between the pen and the screen which makes writing feel funny. I think it's unlikely you'll see such niche apps supported but I don't know their full plans with regards to app support. It kinda seems like you're looking for a different device than what supernote is trying to be, the target is note taking as a top priority. Yeah fair enough, thanks for the feedback. I'm also an app developer and would love to make some eink friendly apps so I guess the boox or likebook devices are the ones for me. I just thought the supernote looked so much nicer! I saw an old comment of a user that suggested a folio with an integrated light. That would be a perfect solution in my opinion.
You have it if you want to, don't have it if you don't want. While waiting for mine to arrive I've been thinking about some of the things I'd like to see added (like Libby/Overdrive)... but I'm also thinking about how difficult the Ratta situation is.

"From what I have understood there is no charger shipped with the device.  
I wanted to ask the following  
a)Does the supernote support fast chargers  
b)What type of chargers does Ratta recommend for the supernote? I mean how many Amphere Here's a comment from hex2asc on A6X charge:
&gt; A6X support USBPD (the main fast charge standard). It's a negotiation protocol. When plugged, the charger will ask A6X, ""how much current you want?"", and A6X always answer,""1.5A is enough"". So the charger will start supply current limited by the agreement. You need not worry about too much current would damage the device. Typically A6X will get full charged in 2 hours by a 7.5W (or more powerful) PD charger.
&gt;
&gt; If you want to use a fast charger, please make sure it's PD type.
&gt; 
&gt; It's also ok if you use a computer USB port for charge, it will take more time than PD charger, at about 3-6 hours. Because of computer USB port usually limit the current supply at 0.5A-1A level.

"Hi,  


I have been deliberating between the Remarkable 2 and Supernote A6x for a while.

I was just about to order the A6x but I saw a lot of people having battery issues. The Remarkable lacks a lot of features against the A6x but the battery is way more superior, it seems.  This is disappointing since rm2 has a 3000 mAh battery vs A6x is smaller with a 2900 mAh battery.

  
However, there have been some latest software updates (one of the 12 days ago) on the A6x and the release notes contains some changes to battery performance. What is the exact status about battery issues right now? If battery is a big deal for me, should I go for rm2 instead? I own both . I cannot recommend the rm2 honestly . Get the a6x or the a5x , stylus is better , more accurate ( never have misalignment issues like I do on the rm2)( no expensive nib replacements ) . Supernote developers are doing fixes and implementing useful and important  features ( have already experienced a few myself ) , where as all the updates on rm2 have been trivial and haven’t really added to the ( already barebones) utility.  I use my a6x many times throughout the day I maybe charge it ever 2 days . The great thing is I charge it with a USB c charger and it charges very quickly , battery is of no concern here coming from someone who’s used it for more than a month now .  The biggest pain point with the rm2 is that you cannot simply plug it in and quickly drag and drop files . You have to use their apps and cloud and other silly workarounds . With the supernote it is just drag and drop , updates instantly . They have also mentioned fixes to help battery further . I recommend supernote Rm2 is also more expensive.

Charging once in two days is not so bad. But do you employ it for heavy use, like taking notes the entire day or something? Sometimes when I’m doing long drawing or long notes i charge every other day . When I’m just using it as a planner many days can go by . So, the weird battery bugs are probably fixed by now, but it still probably stands at somewhere like 6 hours of non-stop writing (from [MyDeepGuide](https://youtu.be/mB8fTVPH1cY?t=948)).

I personally think Supernote is superior simply because you don't need to pay multiple times for a new nib. Though Remarkable 2 and A6X are kind of a bad comparison since, A6X is much smaller. I've had the impression that both A5X and it's upcoming successor (intended to be released Q3 this year), will and are clearly much better than rM2.

Also from what I've heard, rM2 has terrible customer service.

Good question! I also have a rM2--ideally would be great to be able to continue a journal I started on rM2 over to SuperNote. Seems unlikely tho :( I did it by using PDF export.

"Just want to shout out that I got my first e-ink tablet - Supernote A5x! 

I've been thinking about getting one for more than a year, following the development of Sony and Remarkable, and after watching the review by Voja, decided to take a leap and got it.

Quite happy with the device so far, and am excited to find this community and that Supernote is actually seeking users' opinion here!

Happy writing! Agreed! Awesome device paired with amazing customer service and community! I just joined “the family” too, I love that everyone on here (including Ratta Supernote themselves) is so helpful! :) Me too - got mine yesterday and stayed up till 1am figuring out how to customise it and get my stuff on it. Love that Supernote is very active in interacting with the users! And it seems like they will have frequent upgrades.

"I got my A5X yesterday in the post and so far I am loving it!
I am having trouble syncing my Dropbox to the device though. I have connected to my account successfully, and Dropbox has registered that the supernote is connected. 
However when I go to select the folders I want to sync, it does not show my Dropbox folders, only the folders that are already on my device. I've tried rebooting/resetting like a previous post suggested but no luck. Am I missing a step somewhere?
Thanks in advance! I was playing with this last night, and discovered it would only sync folders that were put in the Supernote main folders. It looks like you can’t add folders to those main ones (which are documents, notes, mystyle etc.) To get the main supernote folders to sync you have to select them so they have a tick in the top left hand corner - then they appear in Dropbox) you can then move files into them.

"Morning Coach just posted a quick snapshot of 6 ways the Supernote A5X beats the reMarkable 2:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL3wJnqN2P0&amp;feature=youtu.be

I sent back the RM2 because it looked good but didn’t offer much functionality. Then I returned the Note Air had the opposite problem – bloated with apps and a complicated user interface that made work harder. 

Supernote A5X seems to solve both problems with refined apps built for purpose and a simple, streamlined interface to get things done without any headaches. I’d rather be working on a task than working out how to use the device. This video should be shown to everyone that loves remarkable 2 over other devices lol. Other than sketching, supernote can do everything remarkable can do, and BETTER Well... wait for his ""6 reasons to get Remarkable 2 over A5X"" video in a few days ;) Altho, as an owner of both, I am currently won over by the A5X (even tho I still really enjoy the ""feel"" of the rM2 device and writing when I pick it up and use it). The functionality of the A5X has won me over (love keywords), and not having to replace nibs! Since you have both devices, can you describe the writing experience of Supernote versus reMarkable? A lot of users have trouble describing writing on a Supernote. 

Also, which stylus do you have - the ceramic or the Lamy (I still have my Lamy which I loved using). Remarkable 2 has a ""scratchier"" free. Not in a bad way--in a good way. I guess the best analogy I've heard is: it feels like using a pencil on paper laying on a table or clipboard. It's feels like a harder surface, but again--not in a bad way. Frankly, I still feel like I might prefer it to the A5X feel--even tho the A5X feel is also very good. Yep, I know, maybe not the most helpful.

The A5X has a smoother/slicker feel... and it also depends upon which A5X pen you use. I have both the Heart of Metal and Lamy. The Lamy has a slight scratchier feel, because it's plastic. The HOM is very smooth (ceramic). In reality, the A5X and Remarkable are probably very similar in smoothness--but the Remarkable seems to have more friction/scratchiness due to the sound of its tip on its surface.

FWIW--even though I may enjoy the feel of the remarkable more, i like the sharpness of the A5X pens more. I feel like I can write cleaner/thinner lines on the A5X due to the different pen/surface (especially with the HOM).

As far as which A5X pen I prefer--I still don't know. When I switch to the Lamy, I think ""oohhhh yeah--I think this feels better"". But then I'll use that for awhile, and then switch back to the HOM, and think ""yep, I like the sharpness with this"". So, I guess--get them both if you can(!) I DO love the eraser button on the Lamy--extremely useful. And while I wish the design was a bit better (so I didnt have to find  and line up my finger with the erase button everytime I grab the Lamy), I still think the Lamy is great especially if you think you'll be erasing more than usual. The way I look at it--the Lamy is an eraser I bought that also has a built-in pen ;) And the HOM is for when I just want sharp lines and I'm not worried about making mistakes and/or needing to use the eraser much. The UI's erase function still works well with either one, so not a big deal--but the Lamy's eraser button is very convenient once you have it and get used to it.",Morning Coach lists 6 reasons why Supernote A5X beats reMarkable 2,title prediction
"Dull - but necessary question.  I'd like to use my supernote for both personal purposes and work and therefore do have some questions about how my data is used. There are quite a few users in here from Europe (where GDPR or UK GDPR is applicable).  I had a look at your privacy policy and note that it says that it's only applicable for mainland China.  There is also a statement which says, ""In principle, the personal information we collect and generate in China will be stored in China"" [https://supernote.com.cn/user/PrivacyPolicyEn.html](https://supernote.com.cn/user/PrivacyPolicyEn.html) However you will be processing data which is generated elsewhere and stored in your servers either in China or Amazon Japan.   Please can someone provide more transparency about what happens with our data.  It's worth looking at RM's privacy policy as it does at least contain more specific info about what happens to our data. I usually don t care about this stuff, my data being anyway sold in every part of the globe, but tag me when someone replies, because now I am curious as well. Well... if you're using this as a digital notebook, you're likely storing more than just basic identity info such as email or phone number (the typical data sold around the world). People may choose to store very sensitive information in their notes... if the data is not protected, that data could be exposed. Which is why I'm very leery of putting any sensitive data in my A5X until I have the ability to store in a different service such as Google Drive. Even then, I'm still not fully trusting enough to put sensitive data in this device :( Thank you for bringing this up - it's something very reasonable to ask. I have the same problem as you because I want to use these devices for work and some of the things I write or draw could eventually become IP. If the data gets in the wrong hands, it's pretty well known some Chinese companies can steal and not care about IP ownership laws.
I'm really encouraged by Ratta's responses on this subreddit so would be great to hear from them on this. This is very important!

There are two types of data that will transfer to the server

The first is cloud services

In order to comply with Chinese laws (all companies providing information services in China must set up servers in China. Apple is no exception). But this doen't matter with users outside of China. What we said,  ""In principle, the personal information we collect and generate in China will be stored in China"" is mainly for chinese users. Don't worry about that.

If you want to use Supernote cloud service, we strongly recommend  do not use a Chinese server. (Amazon Japanese server is now available, US server/EU server is coming soon). Otherwise, you can use Dropbox instead. I don’t need to confirm if you are not a Chinese user, because Chinese users cannot see this message (Reddit is blocked in China).

Anyway. The most thorough method, you can turn off the cloud service. Use USB data cable, U disk and other methods to transfer data with computer.

The second is the User Experience Project.

If you agree to participate in the User Experience Project, we will upload some logs. It is usually the performance info in some operation events, such as the time it takes to open the file, the data of battery consumption, and the related information when the fault occurs. We use these data to evaluate and improve performance. It will not be used for purposes not related to improving performance. We will list log types and uses in detail later and update on the website. You are right, We need transparency.

If we need more detailed information for special purposes, such as improving the rendering of handwriting. We will launch a special volunteer program, where participants can send samples of their non-privacy note files to our collection mailbox. We will not store such data in the log.

Anyway, you can refuse to participate in the User Experience Project to avoid uploading any information.

I want to say that your concerns are absolutely necessary.

I.e. when exporting a note as a pdf, it would be great if I could have supernote insert a margin around the note. 

This would be useful if one wished make notes on the exported note using something like Skim on the computer. It would also be useful if the notes are to be submitted to a marker, as the marker would have more space to write comments.

"Just wondering about a possible implementation of a way to rapidly switch between two apps - like ALT-TAB on a computer. At the moment if I want to switch between a note and a book I have to swipe the side bar, then tap on the thing I want. This is pretty good. 

But I just wonder if there could be an option in settings to remap an up-swipe from screen refresh to app-switch. This would make an make it a really quick way to move between two things. 

If this option was selected, the screen refresh function could be activated by an on-screen button in the toolbar. Similarly, if the user chose to keep swipe up to refresh, then the toolbar button could active the app switch.

Just a thought! Interested to hear what others think. I do also really like swipe up to refresh, but for me personally I think I would get more use from switching apps.

Also, the ability to wake the device with a swipe (up or down) would be a nice touch - I find myself trying to do this anyway! :) I think clicking the button to wake to sleep is enough for me, even on my Boox it’s the same thing.

As for the swipe up to switch apps, I like it how it is now (swipe up to refresh), I actually have the same gesture on my Boox. Given that the limited number of apps is visible on swipe down anyway, I find that enough to switch between apps/documents really quickly. I would like this as an option, too. Perhaps it could be an option for the swipe up, to change in settings? Much like the first iPad allowed the switch to be either screen lock or something else (was it mute?), depending on user preference. I hardly use the swipe up. I think it would be awesome to customize and have users choose what they want that action to be. Personally I would like it to open the last most recent note or file so I can quickly switch between two. This would be a neat addition.",Swipe up for rapid app switching (and wake from sleep),title prediction

"I have 6 custom templates... they appear in the device's MyStyle folder, but only 4 of the 6 appear in the Template-&gt;Customization selection screen. Also, there are 2 templates I initially added but then deleted. Everything looks fine on the SuperNote (Japanese) cloud server/website, as well. It's just the the template-&gt;Customization screen that is messed up (only shows some of the custom PNGs I added, and 2 that I deleted are still there).

Yes, I have rebooted--a couple times, and I have sync'd a few times. I also made sure the MyStyle folder was checkmarked in the sync settings.

So... help... More details... I've played with the filenames of the png/template files I uploaded. I made them shorter and removed periods from them. I now get 4 of the 6 templates in my Customization template pages, and the deleted ones are gone. So now, I'm missing 2 of the 6. Is there a reason it will only show the first row of 4 in there? A common issue is the use of special characters in filenames as you have already discovered by removing periods from your filenames. Although the Supernote manuals list various characters to avoid they fail to include underscores in their list ( \_ ) which is often the culprit for custom templates not showing up. No underscores. The files that appear in the Customization page have the same format as those not appearing. Only use letters, numbers and spaces in the fielnames.

"Hey guys, just discovered e-ink devices recently and been doing some research. Even though i love the idea behind it, and am very intrigued to get one, I'm still between the fences about whether i really need one. 

Therefore, I'd like to find out what you guys are really using it for and what made you buy one. After all they aren't cheap devices and i wanna make sure I'm not wasting money. I use it as a daily planner , brain dump, sketch book , notebook all in one place. Helps me to organise my thoughts and notes beyond what I could with a regular notebook. Plus I just much prefer handwriting then typing on computer in meetings etc, I can concentrate better and also be more free in structure which helps me. Finally, the A5X is just so nice to write on that I now actually write more and I’m less precious about pages too! I should add that I also love that it’s not a tablet per say, so less distractions, blue light and need to recharge often. Not to mention no glass! I also own iPad Pro with pencil, and i love using the ipad with pencil mainly for marking up pdfs and notes. I also use it for board games (i'm a big boardgamer), in which I'll track game status/characters/etc by using PDF game sheets in Notability (ipad note taking app), and marking 'em up. BUT... I got intrigued by e-ink note takers for the better non-glass feel and to get away from staring into a computer/lit display. With that said... I'm fairly new with a rM2 and A5X. The software is generations behind iPad... but the e-ink/non-glass experience makes it worth if. Will I be solely e-ink and no iPad for note taking? Not sure. But right now, ive been 100% A5X (after starting with rM2) for about 4 weeks. Also using it for tracking workouts (I maintain a daily workout journal), general daily notes... and the keyword feature on the A5X has won me over, as it allows my to label/tag journal spots for easy searching. Software is quirky/buggy (e.g. the cloud sync functionality), but I'm hopeful (based upon Ratta's strong customer involvement/dialog) these will be ironed out and improved. Before I ve bought the A6X, I wanted to write, but the thought that pages end filled me with dread, so I didn t write. It s a poor excuse, because I do not write even after I acquired an infinite amounf of digital pages.

If I had the money, I would have definitely gone with the iPad Pro, but I am glad I didn t. 

An e-ink tablet is the perfect substitute for a notepad and that s all it is to it.

What sold it to me was the infinite pen and the community that they ve build on reddit, the last being the most important. Now, thinking about it, whatever they would sell, I would buy.

Hi u/Hex2asc,

I’ve had my A5X a few days and I think it’s fantastic. Here is some initial feedback, requests and questions:

&amp;#x200B;

**Feature requests**

* Please can we have caps lock on the keyboard
* Please can we have a way to add accents to letters in the keyboard
* There should be the ability to change the date format (eg dd/mm/yy) from the default American format of month-day
* Should be able to send PNG attachments in email. Currently, sending attachments only works with PDF, while PNG attachments are ignored
* Please can we have indented lists in Word when using bullets?

**Questions**

* In word, is there some way to erase a handwritten mark or writing?   
If I make a mistake while adding handwritten text or marking up, there seems to be no way to delete it, other than double-tapping to convert it and then deleting it after conversion, which is really laborious. It would be great to have an eraser button.

**Other feedback/bugs**

* When switching from handwriting to typing in Word or when turning on repage view, any hand writing on the page is deleted without any warning or asking to convert it first. This is a serious issue and can cause a lot of lost work.
* Backspace connect does not work as described in the manual 
* You can't rename a Word doc when it’s open the way you can with a note. This feels inconsistent
* When renaming a doc or note from the files overview, the 'x' is too far to the right (this does not affect the function, it’s just is an aesthetic UI bug)
* Deleting a document in the cloud from the browser interface does not work. You get a confirmation, but the file stays in the folder, even after sync. The only way to delete it is from the A5X device itself, which then works across the device and the cloud after syncing.

Thank you in advance for your consideration and keep up the great work! Just a quick feedback on ""Please can we have caps lock on the keyboard"".

I can simply double click the ""Shift"" (big up arrow) key. I agree for the date, it is really confusing, it should adjust based on the timezone or let us define the way we want to appear ""Deleting a document in the cloud from the browser interface does not  work.

Awesome! Somehow none of the  reviews I have watched mention the hyperlink support. And I had a very very negative experience with the Remarkable's software making me cautious purchasing cool looking but expensive products.

Is the table of contents collapsible and respecting the hierarchy? I.e. is it easy to navigate a book with four chapters but hundreds of paragraphs in the TOC? Or everything is on the same level (making it difficult to find the chapters)? If the latter, is it on the timeline to fix it?

And is there an option to search for PDF metadata? I plan to have many pdfs on the device and I would like to search for authors/title/arxiv number (if the title is long, then it's not practical to use it as a file name) etc. This fantastic mate.

"All of the other e-ink devices are available on either Android or Linux platforms. Supernote is the only device that gives you a choice because its tablets are available with either operating system. Amazing.

I’d like to know what users see as the pros and the cons of both platforms. Do Supernote’s Linux products have a faster processing speed or better latency? Do the Android devices offer better functionality? 

Why do you think one is better than the other, based on your use case? I’d love to know what Ratta thinks as well and why they are committed to producing two versions of the A6 and A5. I went with the A5X because although I don't use Kindle it seems like the Android OS has more potential for additional functionality in future. It's been working great so far - it does slow down a lot when I'm drawing and using the copy/paste and resizing features heavily but honestly I don't really mind that as drawing really isn't the primary reason I got it. I also can't comment on whether the A5 is any better in this respect - maybe someone else could add something here?

I saw it said somewhere that although the battery capacity is greater on the A5X the android OS is more demanding and so the battery life is actually lower - again I don't have a point of comparison but I certainly haven't had any issues with battery life, keeps going for multiple days.

"I preordered the A6X and I've really enjoyed it as my first ereader and note taking device. However, there are basic navigation features that would make it much easier to use.

It's annoying to flip through tens of pages when navigating through documents and digests. There should be an an option to skip multiple pages, skip to the end, and enter a page number (similar to when navigating documents). Even better would be searching for files or folders in the current directory or skipping by alphabetic ordering (skip to where Hs or Vs begin like a contact book).

It would be nice to have a back button when navigating documents. So when I open a folder, I can go back to the same page in the document navigator rather than flipping through all the pages to get back to the same page.

Most if not all good epub readers automatically embed links to footnotes, so you don't need to flip to the references pages to find the footnote. It'd be really nice if I could tap on a footnote and have the footnote appear in a little window.

One should be able to annotate digests in the document viewer, rather than navigating to the digests app.

Each of these features would improve the ease of use a lot for me. In addition, having a overview that shows a grid of all pages like the remarkable would make it much easier to navigate visually when you don’t already know which page number you want You are in luck!! All of these options are available on your device already! Taping the ellipse in the toolbar brings up the menu which the overview option which brings up page thumbnails. u/official_marcoms. Taping on the page numbers opens up the ability to jump to any page you would like. Dragging down from the top of the screen allows you to search all directories by file name, keywords or stared pages. I highly recommend running through the user manual there are a lot of hidden tools and gestures built into different parts of the device and Ratta is always listening to its users for more feedback! I think I wasn't clear on the page skipping. I don't mean the pages in a document, I mean the pages when browsing through files and folders. It would be great if the same functionality to skip to a page in a document also worked when browsing a folder of documents. I sometimes reverse the sorting so I can at least flip through each page in the list of documents from the reverse of the alphabetic order.

I like the search function, this is ends up being the best way to go. Searching in the current directory is what I usually want, but this isn't so important.

I realized the last feature is in the user manual. I was tapping digests with the stylus, but I figured out that I need to tap it with my finger to annotate a digest.",Feature Request: Navigation and Usability,title prediction

"Random notes from today's waste management class on Vermicomposting. I really like taking notes by hand I find that I remember more of the content when I draw and doolie the ideas out. This is one of the many reasons I really enjoy my supernote. It has become part of my study pattern to go back, edit and clean up the doolies a bit. After class, I will take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour adding to the notes and doodles. The post by u/teicherus of the [possible colors values](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/lmo94r/possible_color_values_for_templates/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) on the SN have me excited about the potential of the current hard wear and to see what other tools are to come! 

Additionally, I enjoyed the use of the floating toolbar, however, I wish I could turn it horizontal again.  I used to keep it docked to left hands side of notes and it was rarely in my way (right-handed). I very much like the ability to collapse it and move it freely but if I could have the choice, either in the settings or on the toolbar, to select horizontal or vertical position when free that would be awesome. Seems like it might be an easy addition?

One other thing I really love is the title page, its use for building a table of contents is perfect functionality! However, I don't like the hash marks. I would like to still be able to differentiate the title without effectively crossing them out.  Is there currently a way to disable that or a workaround anyone has found? For future updates, I personally would rather brackets around the title much like the diegest. Or even a box but the hash marks kinda kill it for me.

The only thing I miss about taking notes on paper is that I used a lot of color-coding and go back through and watercolor them. One day a super note with a color E-ink screen,... now that would be pretty sweet..

I'm trying to figure out how to get a pen that is heavier overall because I'm finding I don't press hard enough to get that feeling of resistance anymore.

You covered all of the features and attributes of the three pens extensively, including the writing experiences. Just what I needed to know. These styluses are another reason to love Supernote.

Just one thing I’m curious about — spoiler alert — I assume the HOM pen is also your favourite for drawing, but what about marking up documents where you’d use a stylus to highlight text rather than write? ... Would Lamy’s “gliding over the paper” be better here than HOM’s “digging into the paper” sensation?

Whatever the case, it’s good to see one manufacturer offering high quality pens (plural) that deliver different benefits to different users. I don't own the basic pen, only the Lamy and the HOM, but I agree with you even if my opinion isn't perhaps as strong!

Now I own the Max Lumi, too, but my go-to is still the Supernote for the calendar, general note-making and the reading smaller page-sized PDFs. I just love the feel of the screen with the HOM! The digest annotation feauture, the sharpness of the screen rendering, the ability to star your faviourites, the way you can organise a notebook, the support team, etc., make this one of the best purchases I have made in a long time, and your videos were key to that, so thanks!

"I've been on and off the last few months waiting to get the RM2, until I discovered SuperNote, and I have a few questions.

1) The A5x and A6x are basically the same exact thing, except for the size of the device? I read elsewhere on the reddit that palm-rejection is missing on the smaller one too, but it's on the road map?

&amp;#x200B;

2) As someone who will use the device for taking various notes, how much of a deal breaker is the size of the A6x vs the A5x in your opinion? I may do some lite kindle reading, but I highly doubt it.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Any general reviews, tips, tricks, etc are welcome. I haven't seen much on here, but I've spent time watching videos from CPO, MyDeepGuide, GoodeReader, and a few other channels. 1. They run the exact same firmware, so functionally yes. The screen of the smaller one/A6X is glass and the larger one/A5X is... not-glass (plastic?)... but same film on the screen. The smaller one has higher ppi. The A6X actually does have palm rejection (I use it!) I think I’ve read here the A5X that doesn’t have it yet but I’m not sure. 

2. For note taking, I would base it on your preferred size of paper notebook. I literally tried measuring it out before I bought one to get a feel for the size haha. A6X screen is basically the size of an iPad mini screen. I think it’s a great size because it’s about the size of the notebooks it replaced for me (Moleskine Large)  but it’s really dependent on what you are comfortable with. 

3. [I did a short sort-of-review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/l7rgn5/a6x_initial_reviewfirst_impressions_latency_etc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) when I got my A6X, with some photo comparisons etc. which might help you decide! I'll make sure to check out the review (I started to earlier, but got sidetracked watching some videos on the devices).

&amp;#x200B;

To try and put size into perspective, if it's a standard college-ruled notebook (or maybe a 1-inch binder) how do the devices compare? 2. Keep in mind that the A6 writing area is small. 4 and 5/8 inch by 6 and 1/8 inch. The external size of the A6X is about the size of an A5 notebook. So if you are used a Moleskine or Leuchtturm1917, you'll want to go with the A5X even though the external size of the A5X is bigger than those notebooks. 

3. If you write small like me, you may go with the 0.2 nib size. But on the A5X, the lines look a bit jagged. Ratta is working on this issue. On the A6X, the higher resolution means I find it more comfortable to write in my usual handwriting size without the cognitive dissonance of the jagged lines. But I like having the physical screen real estate of the A5X. One thing that helped me with the nib size issue is to use a finer point stylus. Those are definitely closer to A5X.

The photos in the post I linked show the A6X, open, next to Rhodia and Moleskine notebooks and a Kindle Paperwhite for reference. I don’t share the experience of the poster below at finding it small (you’ll see in the photo the screen width is about the same as a page on a Moleskine), but you sound like you’re used to much larger paper notebooks so I would skew larger!",Opinions,title prediction
"I have a 6X. When I set it down on a metal cart near my work station it goes to sleep so I could not see my notes. I was getting frustrated thinking maybe that was an intended function to save battery or something. Just realized it only happens on the metal cart. When I set it down on another surface it stay on. Maybe an interaction with the magnet that is used to trigger sleep/wake? Hi u/betterwithchem, I have the same issue on a metal Ikea balcony table. The whole A5X actually feels to stick to the table slightly when the cover flap is folded underneath. Try leaving the cover open like a normal book, instead of folding over and underneath the device. I have better results like that usually... That is definetly the sleep function the supernote has for its folio. When ever the folio closes the supernote will go to sleep and when opened it will wake up the supernote. This is done with magnets. Since the table is metal the supernote's think it's the folio in its closed position and it goes to sleep, try placing something like a book or a cardboard between the supernote and the surface to avoid that problem. Maybe even consider using a stand. /u/hex2asc Is there a way we can get a switch in the settings to disable close-to-sleep?

"I use my A5X to take notes primarily, but thinking of trying the RM2 because I have been less than impressed with battery life? Any thoughts? I have the A6X and RM2 and honestly prefer the A6X.  The RM2 seems bulky even though it isn't really.  I like how the a6x feels to write on (though I hate the new movable menu.  HATE), and the RM2 does not feel like paper.  The menus seem more difficult to navigate, though I probably just need more practice.  If yoyve already got the a5x id just stick with that. &gt;already got the a5x id just stick with that.

My thought as well. Battery life on the rM2 is great when the device is idling (not in use) when in use it's not that great, but more than enough. You might get better battery life with the rM2 (don't have both, can't compare) but the difference won't be that big, and the rM2 is more fragile (glass based screen, some people have problem with the little button because it's in a zone that easy to shock, etc.). If you have a SN and it suits your need, no need to bother with the rM2 IMO, unless battery life when idling is your main criteria. Yes, I have both, and I have to say, it's a really tough call between them, but at the moment, I'm leaning more to the A5X.

Points in the RM2's favor:
* Significantly longer battery life
* Best writing feel (in my opinion)
* Calligraphy pen (I love it!)
* Thumbnails show writing on PDFs (this is important to me because I edit a lot of PDFs and it's easier to keep track of what document I've worked on)

Points in the A5X's favor:
* Ceramic nib, no more replacing plastic nibs
* Continued platform development (calligraphy pen coming soon, along with many other developments)
* Wakes up when folio is opened

The ceramic nib is what tips my preference for the A5X: I hate the idea of having to replace nibs every two weeks to a month (depending on how much writing I'm doing) and gives me the mental freedom to write and write without thinking about how I'm wearing down the nib, or ordering new ones, and so on. The fact that Ratta is so responsive to users also stands in stark contrast with Remarkable's radio silence. I know that the Supernote platform will continue to improve, so I'm willing to wait for things like a calligraphy pen. (And they are also working on battery life -- it's never going to reach the same level as RM2's, but I wouldn't be surprised if they managed to get another day out of the existing design.)

If what you're looking for is for someone to assuage your concerns that you may have made a wrong decision, here it is: stick with the A5X, the Remarkable is not significantly better to justify forking over a ton of money for similar functionality. Yes, the battery life is better, and I love the feel, but unless the A5X's battery life is causing you major headaches, stick with what you've got.",Does anyone have Remarkable 2 and Supernote A5X?,title prediction

"I recently returned a reMarkable 2 and replaced it with the A5x. Overall I'm happy with the switch, but there are two features I REALLY miss:

1. The send to reMarkable Chrome plugin which allowed me to send pretty much any article I found online to my reMarkable as a PDF. Amazing! Any chance Ratta could offer something like that?
2. The ability to simply flip the stylus around and use the other end as an eraser. It is so much easier and more natural. And yes, I have the Lamy pen but don't use it at all because my finger often accidentally pushes the erase button. If you print from you desktop and save to your Dropbox folder (if you sync that way) it is just as quick in my experience. 

But I also am on a Mac and don’t like chrome. So I am not the most objective. 

On my iPhone I use the Instaweb browser and it prints to an a5 pdf format which i save to my Dropbox folder and it is quicker and more reliable than the remarkable app in my experience. 

I am supportive of the idea of a chrome plugin. But I think the syncing options on supernote make it unneeded Thank you for your feedbacks. I think something will be change. I haven't found the dropbox synching to be that easy to set up. And it's hard to imagine anything easier than being on a site like The Atlantic, going to the top right of the browser and clicking the button that says ""send to reMarkable"" and having it instantly appear on your tablet.

"Wondering if anyone else lately is noticing issues with the screen? I've had my A6X for about 6 - 8 months, but the last probably month or so am noticing some issues (Tried looking for similar problems but didn't see any, if I've missed this issue posted somewhere else please let me know!)

*Processing video 0vi6y64bq9q61...*

1. Not recognising touch. I've attached a video from this morning. It's not all the time, but happening probably every 2nd day now, it randomly won't recognise touch input - only pen; or vice versa. Restarting does work, but I often have to restart 2 or 3 times for it to work, and sometimes it won't restart (it just sits there refusing to accept either input). 
2. The bottom half of the screen seems to be not always responding properly to pen input. Having trouble filming this, as I notice it mostly during lectures when I'm writing a LOT in a short amount of time, and am willing to accept that it could well be me writing in a hurry and causing the issue. Occasionally when I write, the words/strokes are half missing, like a pen running out of ink. And on the right-hand size, about 1/3rd of the way down, there's a weird ""blip"" section where if I draw a straight line, it instead sometimes curves outwards (again, hard to film, it doesn't seem to do it when I want to hahaha) or if I write on lined templates near there it won't write in that spot, instead bunching the letters up behind it as if I were trying to write off the edge.

I haven't dropped, damaged, banged, spilled anything on, sat near or on a magnetic device, or in any other way I can think of caused any damages to the device, I study from home and it lives on my desk 95% of the time. Any thoughts? I'll try to get a video of the ""low ink"" issue asap. Hopefully this is just a simple thing fixed in the next update :) I have similar issues but mine do not seem as prevalent as yours. At times my A5X will not recognize a finger touch until I use the stylus first. But after I use the stylus once it usually goes back to normal. Yeah, it used to do that rarely, but this has become much more pronounced, and the only fix I can find so far is a restart (or three hahaha). It's not happening often enough to really be a huge problem or anything, but the increase has me a bit worried. And the words not writing properly at the bottom are a bit concerning too, but I'm still not sure if that's just how I'm writing, or a genuine issue. Hey mate, are you still experiencing this issue or did Rata sort it out yet? I've been looking to get one of these devices but have seen this complaint pop up a couple times and am just wondering if its an ongoing thing. I was, and ended up emailing about it, and they replaced the device. I am having some possible issues with the new one, but not sure yet if that's just me (different problem). Regardless, I absolutely love mine, even if there are a few bugs or problems. I think pretty much every company will have issues like this, but the stand-out thing for me is their customer service and support. Even with the issues, they've been fantastic at talking it out and trying to sort out the issues; plus they listen to us as customers when we suggest changes or things we'd like to see.",Screen Issues,title prediction
"I have a couple of custom Note templates I use for meetings. One has a Title/Attendee/Follow Up area at the top that I use as the first page of notes for any meeting, and then when I continue taking notes on the next page, I change to the 8mm rule stock template. Then the next time I have a new meeting for the same client or project, I switch back to my custom template for that first new meeting note page.  


So, my request(s):

&amp;#x200B;

* Can we have an option to sort templates with custom ones first when we go to template selection? That would put my three custom ones first, and then the 8mm ruled one would be immediately following, and I would not need to go to the next page of templates every single time a new meeting comes up.
* In the alternative, give us the ability to rename templates so we can then sort them in any order by name.
* This third is a long shot. Can we specify how many pages a template will be used when selected, and then the one to follow it? So, I can have my custom template selected, and when I go to the next page, it will automatically shift to the ruled template I select as the second page of any meeting. Then I'll only need to select my own template for the first page of a meeting, and not need to select any other. This should override the system default for the Note template.

Thanks! I was thinking last night how much easier it'd be to be able to sort the templates, just hold to rearrange so the most-used are first in the list or something. Most used or last used would work very well for my use case. I just hate to go to the second page of templates for no good reason almost every time I have a meeting. Agreed, I use mine mainly for study and have made up some templates for definitions or equations and some summary sheets for lectures or chapter notes, and having to keep scrolling through them all to set those up for each lecture is not quite ""annoying"" as such, but it would be simplified with the option to arrange how I'd like. It's not a hugely inconvenient thing, but I was uploading more last night and starting to realise just how many I have now, and thinking that it's going to become a bit harder to find what I want (I am a self-confessed digital-hoarder and can absolutely guarantee I'll end up with way more templates than I need or use regularly hahaha) Most used or let the user rearrange the order to their own accord.",Feature Request - Template Sort Order,title prediction

"First, I’d like to thank this forum, as it has been key for my decision to buy this fantastic device. I reserved a Remarkable last summer and changed my mind after being surprised on how responsive the Supernote community was.

I’ve used the A5X for more than 2 months now and I absolutely love it. I’m not the artist-type of user and my goal was to use it as a replacement of my work paper-based notebooks. I have to say the A5X nails it for this purpose.

However, there’s always gap for improvement and I’d like to request some improvements that will make my life easier.

1) Move pages to other notes. Believe this was already requested. To me this is a key feature as the copy-paste is not always working as expected.
2) Improvements in copy-paste. It happened to me a couple of times that I paste something on the wrong place and didn’t find the way to redo the paste. It looks like the clipboard is emptied after the paste so, if you undo it, you lose the copied data. This made me lose some selections and makes me now be very careful with the copy-paste.
3) Digest without comments. I think the digest feature has a lot of potential. I use it intensively as a marker without adding comments. When retrieving the digest I see lots of blank spaces and even an option to remove the “marked” text and keep only the comments. I’d love to have it the other way around. A version without comments, so that I can get a summarized version of the book based on the marked text.
4) Improved sensitivity on the toolbar. Not sure of this but I recently got the feeling that, since I upgraded to one of the latest versions, I need to press harder to make a selection on the toolbar (e.g. switch between the pen and the rubber). This is also a bit annoying as sometimes I have to try 2 or 3 times before getting the correct tool. I believe there has to be a way to increase its sensitivity so that’s easier to select.

I hope my comments help to improve this already-amazing device. Thanks for your feedback and great suggestions! Thanks for your sincere feedback and suggestions. Yes,  the function of moving pages to other notes , which is one of the most important features that will be available in the future, each page is independent which should be moved between different notebook freely , that is similar to a binder.   Additionally,  ""a version without comments in digest"" and ""improving the sensitivity on the toolbar"" will all been submitted  to the IT team for further optimization.   Best Regards Thanks for your quick response as usual.

I have two more requests, I've just realized:

1) Be able to remove ""Star Mark"" from the search. When I search for star marks, it finds  stars that are not viewable in the note. What I mean is that I open the note and I cannot find the start mark. I believe maybe a dot or something very small is detected as a star. As I cannot delete it from the note, I believe the best would be to be able to delete it from the search page (e.g. long press to have the option to delete)

2) Select button on the ""compressed"" floating toolbar. The compressed toolbar is a great idea but I miss the selection button, which forces me to extend it. I think it would be great to have it there together with the pen, rubber, do and undo buttons.",A5X feedback after 2 months,title prediction

"Hi Everyone,

I know these kinds of questions have been asked a lot already, but I would still prefer some feedback on my specific use-case. First things first, I am planning on buying a reader and am deciding between the A5x and the Boox Note Air. I want to use the tablet to read academic journal articles while sitting outside in the sun. Now, most of what I will be doing is just reading, though I will generally do some note-scribbling at the side of pages as well. It sounds as if the Lumi Max would be my ideal option, mainly due to its size, but I don't really want to spend $900 on this so I'm stuck between the A5x and the Note Air. Voya, and others, seem to suggest that the Note Air has a slightly better/faster reader, which, I think, would be very important for me. On the other hand, It's a bit more expensive since you have to get an extra pen and, from my understanding, does not have the same Dropbox support that the Supernote has.

Has anybody tackled the question from a similar standpoint? Would really appreciate some more thoughts.

Thanks I have owned the Lumi and the A5X and prefer the A5X because the screen is more crisp (less layers between base panel and your eyes), the pen is better, the annotation features are smart (digest and stars), it feels more durable and notebook-like, and the company is very receptive to feedback. However, Boox devices are very, very fast. Much faster than the Supernote, although I don’t mind the occasional 1-2 second delay in between gestures etc. because I love what the device stands for. The PDF reflow/crop/landscape mode features on the Boox are more advanced than what the Supernote has currently. The Boox Max Lumi and Note Air don’t feel like very well thought out devices, but their capabilities are very powerful if you know what you are doing in the Android ecosystem. 

Tl;Dr: I owned a Lumi and sold it because the text wasn’t very crisp (too many layers on the screen) and the pen sucked. The A5X is a quality, purpose built device with a perfect pen for notetaking and annotating simpler, one-column a4 PDFs but anything more complex and you will meet its limitations very quick. Some thoughts: the Boox Note Air is based on a Carta screen, it has a thin layer of glass and can break quite easily. The A5X (or Note 3) might be more durable.

A5X is more on a minimalist approach even though it's android based. 

I'd say that there is more chances that you get long term support on the A5X, Onyx tends to release new devices and to forget about older ones, that receive no software updates when new models are released. Hard to tell how Ratta will be on the long run on that front, but from what we can read, them seem to be planning to provide upgrades for longer than Onyx.",A5X vs Note Air for PDF annotating,title prediction

Just wondering how it would holdup when the tip would fall on a hard flour i.e. hardwood or paving stone when in garden. I guess time will tell.

I was torn between 6X and 5X. Mobility versus writing space. I intend to transition from A5 paper notebook BJ, of which I started the 7th now, to the SN. Have scanned in the paper BJ's converted to PDF which I intent to import to SN and create a grant index page. Planning to use/utilise/create a template for daily sheet that has some pre-set goal trackers / quotes or at least space for them that should stay on the page  for a whole month or even year as a reminder and without having to flick pages. So space would be already taken up by that and in that respect the A5x made more sense. A5x also allows more flexibility when going to draw concepts/mindmaps/process diagrams etc.

Also looking forward to using this as a learning driver. For example if one wants to learn all chemical elements you could use one layer to show an empty periodic table and then try to fill out all elements and their properties from memory on another layer and the repeat by deleting the 2nd layer without having to re-draw or print out the table structure and all that without  a paper mess and no need for a printer. I have/tried the Galaxy Tab S7 pen, the Staedtler Noris Jumbo, the HoM, and the standard Sn pen.  The HoM is fine, but the one I use most is the standard pen it came with.  I'm still eying the LAMY, for the eraser button.  But It's hard to justify spending another $60-70USD for a 4th pen (I returned the Jumbo).  

I prefer not having to replace nibs.  I do have the same question about ""impact durability"" though.  Thankfully I haven't yet had to find out.  

I really was using a daily planner template with a Tasks, Meetings-at-a-glance, Quick Notes, and Scratchpad page for every day of the year.  I've fallen out of the habit lately though and pretty much have only been using it for meeting notes.  I like your learning driver method. I also just ordered.

"Hi, everyone! I'm wondering about your experience using the proofreading tools on the Supernote.

If so - why start with a Pentagram? Am I able to turn it off in this version? I'd love a auto-draw feature like procreate has. This would make the Supernote so much more useful! It’s in the manual under Symbol recognition I believe. You can search for the star symbols in your notes/documents Thanks for the quick reply. Missed it in the manual apparently.

What I do is draw the star next to the note.  Then, I can later tap on what looks like a table of contents symbol in the top left of the menu bar, and the star symbol in the right corner of that menu, and see all of the pages I've starred in that file.

My only gripes are: 1) it doesn't always recognize the star when I draw it, and 2) it would be great if I could select some of the text what I starred so I could see it in the ToC view instead of have to jump to the page in order to read it.",What's up with the supernote converting a drawn pentagram into a perfectly drawn one?,title prediction

"I wasn't sure whether to write this post or not. I was planning on using an ewriter to organise all my notes and lists at home (I seem to generate 100's of sheets of paper). The problem for me is it's for personal use and so not offset against tax etc which means I'm fairly price sensitive and these things are unfortunately close to the limit of what I'll pay.

Getting unbiased info on these devices is quite difficult. The youtube reviewers were very positive on the A5X but then they were very positive on every ewriter they reviewed which didn't really help me much. I ended up trawling through hours of reviews trying to work out the pros and cons of every device and tried to work out what would suit me best. In the end I chose the A5X as I liked the design, the ease of use and the extra functionality that keeps getting added. 

Two days ago I thought damn it, I'll just buy it. I knew the discount price was finished and had convinced myself that the full price was worth it. Then a shipping charge of $57 got added. I figured I better check the functionality to make sure I'm getting exactly what I want and stopped the order. A day later, I'd got the answers I needed here, and I thought I should still go ahead and place my order. I picked the standard package. OK'ed the shipping price, then was told about possible extra taxes etc to the UK. I gave up at that point.

I'm sure the A5X is great but I can't test it before buying and it seems I can't even work out what I'm I'll actually be paying. I decided not go ahead and instead just rely on paper and pencil for the moment. Hopefully it will appear on Amazon in the future and hopefully I'll be able to afford it. I hear you. It's expensive. All these ewriters are. And it's certainly not essential. It's a tough call. I decided (i.e., believe without actually trying yet) that it will work for what I'm looking for (one thing is to free me from needing to sit in front of my computer to read and annotate long PDFs). But I agree that it would be so much nicer to have a model one could try first. If I were you I'd stay connected here because if a deal on a used device comes available, your best bet for hearing about it will be right here. I decided to go ahead and order (with all the extra shipping and taxes to Canada), because I think this will make a big difference in my workflow (for my actual job).

I definitely intend to use the first 30 days (during which it can be returned for full refund) to see if I like it, and it provides the functionality I want/need. As you pointed out, buying expensive ""toys"" without being able to try them first is a bit of a leap, but I have NO PROBLEMS shipping it back for a refund if I decide it won't work for me. Frankly, if more people insisted on good return policies, I think we'd all feel better about buying new/unavailable tech (since we would have the comfort of knowing that it isn't money flushed down the toilet if it ends up not working for us). I would look for a used one if you are really price-conscious. I bought one used for about $40 under the price of new. You may have to wait a little bit, but it is possible. There is a thread for used ones for sale.

I would look for the thread here that has used devices for sale. Exactly. The A5 (non-X) can sometimes be found at a very decent price, it could be an alternative if budget is important and a more minimalist device can work out fine for your needs, [u/mike\_bike\_kite](https://www.reddit.com/user/mike_bike_kite/)",Information and pricing,title prediction

"Hi,  


I have just watched a [video](https://youtu.be/CXjYHtfDP6A?t=2372) where a PDF, filled with hyperlinks is used almost as if it was an app. I believe this is very similar to the zettelkasten feature which I've read about on the subreddit.

  
This idea got me really excited and upon arriving at the section which shows the PDF on the A5X (which I preordered) it is clearly mentioned and shown that you cannot follow hyperlinks with a single tap. There's always that menu which shows ""Jump To"" which you have to tap again.  
Is it possible to configure this (or change the default) behaviour? If not, I would like to request this :-)  
It should be easy to implement and could very well live alongside the actual zettelkasten feature.

&amp;#x200B;

thanks,

Crucidal [deleted] The inner hyperlinks within the documents are available on Supernote A5X, the prompt of "" Jump to“ ， which designs to avoid unintentional touch which caused to jump to a certain hyperlink page by accident, which might also cause some "" inconvenience"". I agree that there is an inconvenience in both scenarios. However, the touch is not over sensitive and in my experience, being able to hit the hyperlink is enough secure in itself to avoid most unintentional jumping. To me it would be awesome with an option to turn this off, just like you can turn off touch recognition. The power of freedom and customization :) My current experience is purely from e-readers like the kindle paperwhite.(is it fair to assume this would translate to the a5X as well?)I've never experienced unintentional touches there. The palm rejection should ""fix"" other scenarios in which you might accidentally press a hyperlink.It seems like the Jump To was built to prevent ""annoyance"" for a use case that probably rarely happens in comparison to how often you intentionally press it.

Handling unintentional navigation could also be solved by providing a means to quickly go back to the previously shown page. either by a temporarily hovering menu or a built-in shortcut (like double tapping the lower left corner or something)Purely looking at ""handling unintentional navigation"" my suggestion takes 2 page refreshes and that's definitely slower than the ""jump to"" menu. But if you would multiply this by some weight which represents how often you unintentionally navigate vs intentionally, I think it would outweigh the drawbacks :-)","feature request: A5X directly follow internal links without showing ""Jump to"" menu?",title prediction

"Hi r/Supernote. 

&amp;#x200B;

I purchased my Supernote A5X in January and have been using it for a few months now. I absolutely love it. I basically don't use real paper anymore. Over the past several months, my Supernote has become one of my most precious items -- I carry it around with me everywhere. It contains my calendar (actually, Voya's calendar, it's really great!), my todo lists, my personal journal and diary, my work documents, and my school documents and papers. The Supernote team should feel proud that they have created and commercialized such a fabulous device. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to suggest some features, but I don't want to imply that I'm not fully satisfied with the product. The Supernote has brought me alot of joy and I really am happy. In the future, here's what my perfect Supernote device would look like:

&amp;#x200B;

Reading &amp; Note Taking Improvements:

* **Split Screen View.** I wish I could view a document and a note side-by-side at the same time, especially if I turned my Supernote sideways.
* **No annotation tag.** Annotations in PDFs have a small circular ""D"" or ""A"" symbol at the end of each selection that blocks the text underneath. Do we really need these symbols? It would be great to turn them off, or to somehow move them to the side so I can read the text underneath. 
* **Improve the Underlining/Annotating Experience.** When trying to underline a sentence in a PDF, it is too easy to grab (1) the leading whitespace before the first word or (2) the trailing whitespace after the last word or period. It would be great if Supernote was smart enough to omit leading and trailing whitespace characters when underlining.
* **Free the Title.** In a Note, do ""Titles"" really need to be obscured with dark diagonal slashes? What is the point of hiding the text underneath the Title? Perhaps I don't understand this function. Wouldn't it be better if, instead, the text was surrounded by a box that you could see through? Why do I want dark squares in my Note? Why do I want to hide the Title?
* **Change the Lasso Icons.** I feel like the lasso icons are backwards. After I lasso a word or phrase in a Note, the box with a ""T"" in it is *not* for ""Title"" -- it creates a keyword. And the box with ""dots and lines"" is not to create keywords, but to create a ""Title"". I keep getting these mixed up because ""T"" = ""Title"". Am I thinking about this wrong?  I feel like these icons should be swapped, or changed completely.
* **Use UTF-8 Encoding in Digest.** The Digest does no seem to have a full set of UTF-8 fonts. For example, the South Korean won symbol, ₩, does not show correctly in the Digest.

&amp;#x200B;

PDF Improvements:

* **PDF to Note copying.** I want to be able to copy text from an annotation/digest (i.e., the text that I have underlined) and paste it into a Note file.  
* **PDF Snip Tool.** I wish I could lasso an area of a PDF and the copy that over to a Note as an image. 
* **Add Layers to PDFs.** Right now, layers only work in Notes. It would be nice to be able to use layers on top of PDFs. 
* **Copy Written Doodles from PDF to Note.** I wish I could write a little note and/or doodle in a PDF and then cut/copy that into a Note. 
* **Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus.** I want a dictionary and thesaurus feature for PDFs and ePubs (and, Notes?). The Kindle app comes bundled with one, but I can't use that feature outside of Kindle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Potential Bugs:

* **Fix E-mail Typo.** When you enter an incorrect e-mail address (e.g., ""supernote@.com"" is an incorrect e-mail address format) then the error message says ""Please check mailbox"" instead of ""please check e-mail address.""
* **Clean up Keywords.** In a Note, when I lasso a word and mark it as a keyword, it appears as a keyword in the menu. Great. But, when I erase the keyword in the Note, the keyword still appears in the menu. Is that normal? 

&amp;#x200B;

Miscellaneous / Other:

* **Creating geometry.** I want to be able to tap two points on my Supernote device with the pen and have a straight line drawn between them. That's it. That's the feature. I just want to draw straight lines between two arbitrary points. 
* **Creating tables.** I want to be able to tap on my Supernote device with the pen and drag it down to create a table (e.g., a 3x3 or 5x5 or 7x7 table). 
* **Search for Keywords in Digest.** I wish I could search for some text in my Digest (not the notes I make in my Digest, but rather the digest printed text itself). 
* **More Quick Access.** Right now, Supernote only allows 4 Documents and/or Notes in the Quick Access area. I wish I could have a more, especially since adding a 5th document/note completely removes the 1st, and unlinking the 5th does not restore the original 1st. 
* **Quick Access List Reordering.** I wish I could reorder the documents and notes shown in the Quick Access list. But this only makes sense if the documents/notes in the Quick Access area are some how ""sticky"" or ""permanent"". My A5x is scheduled to arrive Monday, and this list looks like a great way to help me get started (in terms of ""things that might not work the way I thought they would""). I hope the supernote team sees this, are they active here? Can you actually ""page"" them so they can be sure to see it? This is a great, carefully considered list of requests and I agree with the vast majority of them.

The biggest one, for me, is the ability to draw straight lines between two points. That would solve a big pain point.

Otherwise, like you, I love this thing. Three months in and it’s now indispensable. Yeah, I use a ruler to draw straight lines, like on pen and paper! xD Super notes does review comments, I was hoping they came out with a calendar with reminders.

Thanks!! Square brackets? These create a separate doc called a digest where you can add your notes relating to that section of the pdf. You click on the text to take you to the digest page.

Received custom import tax payment request via email from DHL on 30. April 7:05 am GMT. Paid right after, process was straight forward. (€129 for Ireland with 23% VAT).

"Hi all

*I posted similar to the below in the remarkable subreddit not realising a5x had a sub.

I'm a Psychologist based in Australia and I'm looking to go digital with my in session note taking. I'm looking for some advice as there's a lot of options.

I think I'm leaning towards the a5x or papyr. I've been watching morning coach and my deep guide most of the morning and it seems that these two devices have improved since release/have good customer service.

How would the a5x go with the below?

Priority
- Note taking/writing is #1 for sure
- Custom note templates (I use a session note template)
- Ability to easily erase what I write
- Ability to export/email my notes to my computer
----- If I could export to a specific folder on my computer that would be ideal
- Ability to create flowcharts/diagrams etc easily as I often use a whiteboard in session

Bonus features
- Would be great if I could export my notes to a specific folder on my computer
- I often put a sticky note on my session note to remind me of things to bring up with the client, but I'm not sure if any device could replicate this?
- Being able to bring up pdfs/highlight and write on them
- Ability to screenshare
- Ability to create a to do list
- Handwriting to text. My hand writing is pretty chicken scratch, but this could be useful in future as I write the same words a lot (so text prediction too)

If anyone has any other suggestions I would be more than happy to hear them. I love my A5X and think it checks off all of your must have boxes and many of your bonus features as well. 

* I really like the writing experience and find it very natural and easy to write on. 
* You can set the note template to be anything you want. There are tons of community created templates and creating custom ones is very simple and straight forward. 
* If you go with the standard or HOM supernote pens, you don't get an eraser button but I don't find it a hassle to switch to the eraser  in the tool bar. I also like the lasso eraser feature a lot and find it easy to use. 
* I have my supernote synced via dropbox. So whenever I choose, all of the files are synced to my computer for reference. You can set up specific folders in dropbox and the files will transfer flawlessly between them. I've never had an easier cloud-syncing experience. 
* I'm not quite sure what you mean by creating diagrams. With Supernote, you are able to draw like you would on a piece of paper. They've hinted at potentially adding drag and drop shapes to notes as well.
* Supernote has several options for marking up and bookmarking documents so you can go back to them later. This might work fo you. 
* You can bring up and write on PDFs. Highlighting is a little strange because its only B/W but it does work.
* Screen sharing is not an option :(
* There are to do list templates and quick access features that make to do lists a breeze to create and update on supernote. 
* I think they are working on handwriting to text for notes but it's not an option yet. 

I cannot recommend supernote enough. I really like the design decisions that Ratta made. The pen loop and aluminum rail system keep the pen and device attached to the folio in a more secure way than magnets do. The writing experience feels great. And the supernote team has been so responsive and listens to the community. This is massively helpful - thank you. You've answered everything so I really appreciate it. I'll have to make though I can avoid using the cloud when it comes to client related notes while still having the ability to export/email them to myself. So I'll ask supernote about that. You can also transfer via usb. 

There is an email function, and I assume that you can send attachments via it (but I haven't used it as I wanted a distraction free device for writing)",Questions on a5x features,title prediction
"Hello Supernote users! I recently updated my Supernote A5X (the day after the newest update came out) and the new features are really great additions. However... the past two days I noticed immense battery drainage. I left my half-charged (give or take) Supernote overnight, waking up to 6%. The day after, left an 85% charged device, only to find it at 55%. Now, this is a HUGE battery drainage problem... and if this is coming from the update, I'm wondering if anyone else had noticed it AND if anyone has considered going down one update for this very reason? As much as I like being able to save my notes as a vector, the last thing I need is my device to feel like my phone, something to constantly be worried about with battery life.

"Hi Can we turn off the jump to request? I have hyperlinked PDF files and I would like to navigate a tad faster by clicking only once?

PS. In love with my A5X xx Our team has discussed this internally. The reason why there is no direct jump is that we lack a shortcut for ""go back"". If the user accidentally triggers the jump, it is inconvenient to return to the previous page. We are developing a convenient way to go back, and at that time, we will enable direct jumps. :) Perfect, thanks ! That's an interesting problem. I know I'm biased here, but I imagine the number of users wanting to go forward with one click far outweighs the number of exceptions of a miss click.

It's just a shame to see videos of the REmarkable clicking through at a high pace for a nice UX feel and the A5X having that friction of double touch...even though you've already built the equivalent capability.

I am being tempted by the Remarkable's texture and pen tool.  Convince me otherwise!

I have ordered the LAMY pen to compare the difference and ordered the Remarkable knowing I can return.  I do a LOT of drawing and my senses are highly sensitive.  I thought I read somewhere about someone who's screen was more textures on. one device than another.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there a way to get a more textured (less slick) drawing experience on the Supernote? Screen protector? Pen?
2. Anyone know if there is a Pencil tool in the works?

(Please know, as much as I am enjoying RM2, Supernote has my heart) No and I don’t know. Just stick with the RM2 if you like drawing. 1.No, you can't add a screen protector because you already have one and you can't remove it because the ceramic pen works with it. For me the first advantage of the ceramic tip is that the tip is thinner.

2) Yes, the pencil brush will be available soon and I look forward to it. The algorithm is done since the beginning of the year, you can see a demo on Supernote's Twitter here :

"I know another one of these threads. I promise I read through as much as I could before posting here but want some fresh perspectives on this given my needs with a device like this.

Both of these devices seem great but I'm torn on which one to get. For my use, I'll only be writing (no drawing or sketching) and I'll primarily be using the device for work meeting notes, to do lists, and daily bullet journaling. I will not use the eReader functionality (already have a Kindle for that) or the PDF viewer/markup functionality. This will be a purely writing device for me. I watched some YouTube videos and both have pros and cons and I can't figure out which one is best for my use. 

The reMarkable 2 looks beautiful and is super thin, which is nice. I also like its UI much better than the Supernote UI - I don't feel like I'll be multi-tasking on a device like this much as I won't be going back and forth between a PDF and notes or anything like that and I don't mind a couple extra presses to get back to my notes (though it looks like rm2's upcoming 2.7 firmware is going to add improved navigation for quickly switching between documents too). The rm2 also has the better OCR, which is something I know I'll use frequently. I already used this often on my Surface to convert handwritten notes. The remarkable 2 also exports writing in a non-rasterized format which is a nice pro. 

The A5X has much better organization options like bookmarks and searching - which would be immensely helpful. The pen is also looking like a huge plus here. I love real luxury pens and own a few fountain pens. So the options Supernote offers are really nice. Plus not ever having to replace the nib is huge and seems like it'd be a nice money save over time. The Supernote also seems to make templates much easier to create and use - which I would for things like my bullet journaling.

My final concerns are price and support. I could use a referral code for the rm2 and get it for over $100 cheaper than the A5X. But I've also heard bad stories of remarkable's support and it's nice to see Supernote engaging with the community. But I also worry that despite that engagement, if something goes wrong I have to send things back overseas which could be expensive or cause long delays (I'm in the US).

Would love to hear the thoughts of people who were trying to decide between the two as well. Especially if you use your device similar to how I described I would above. Thanks! Tough call. Personally, I ended up returning my RM2 and went for the Supernote, see my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/n2ieu3/advice_a5x_vs_rm2/gwyemv3/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Then again, my use case is different.

Why don't you try out the Remarkable and see how you like it? (They offer free returns, after all.)

One thing I'd keep in mind: The writing experience. This is a very personal thing and, personally, I prefer the feeling of the Supernote. &gt; see my comment here

Thanks for that. Helpful. Your points about the areas rm2 wins are also things to consider. Seems like the responsiveness is better. Also the recent 2.6 update seems to have fixed the jagged lines issue on the remarkable. 

&gt; Why don't you try out the Remarkable and see how you like it? (They offer free returns, after all.)

This is a good point. Though I'd feel bad about using someone's referral code only to return the device so they don't get the credit.

Honestly though, if the Remarkable 2 had bookmarks and tags that were searchable it'd probably win for me pretty easily. Though I'd still be lusting after the Supernote's pens and nibs you don't need to replace. I use my device primarily for note taking and planning.  (Consulting on clients). I also purchased both to see which would be better.  SUPERNOTE won.  For me it came to writing, my handwriting needed a .5 and the RM2 was not fine enough and when I switched to the pencil thin, it was too light and hard to read.  As much as I liked the look and feel, it was a deal breaker.  Also, the nib replacement just seemed a hassle.  Love the durability of Supernote.  Supernote can save to cloud or OneDrive which I like, but there is a lot more storage on Supernote than RM2.
Would like to see more “helpful” hints from the company but right now the 3rd party people are doing a nice job for me.
Hope this helps! Thanks. I appreciate this perspective. The pen is a huge reason why I'm still unsure which one to go with. The Supernote's pens all seem superior to anything else on the market - both in feeling like a real pen and also the thinness of the nib. Definitely something I'm putting a lot of weight behind. But so much else about the rm2 seems better for my use cases.",Supernote A5X or reMarkable 2?,title prediction

"Hello Supernote team!  
I just recently purchased a used Supernote device and love the fact that you promote the second hand market for Supernote devices, instead of trying to squash it (I am looking at you Apple!). The ability to buy and sell Supernote devices is amazing because it not only gives a Supernote buying ""*insurance""*  that they can sell the device if it does not work for them, or help those who cannot pay full price afford one, but it also helps keep ewaste out of the landfills.   


That said, while going through the process of finalizing a deal there we were a couple things that concerned/annoyed me though.   
1. Very few rules - Normally anytime you are buying and selling something on Reddit the subreddit has strict rules that help prevent scams. Some of these include recent timestamped photos, addition to the universal scammer list, only allowing payment through paypal goods and services, having the buyer/seller say which state they live in, and a flair that shows how many trades a user has. A perfect example of these rules is r/hardwareswap and r/AVexchange. Implementing some of these rules would greatly help everyone avoid scams.  


2. Hard to find people selling - People who were selling their devices often not only used the trades mega thread but also made new posts or commented on other posts. This caused an issue where it was hard to know if you were seeing all the people interested in selling their devices or not.   


3. Vague price history - Often times the original post showing the final sale price was gone so it was hard to determine what a good deal was or not. Making sure these stay up would greatly help everyone know they are getting a good deal. 

4. Sellers not including screenshots or condition - Most of the time sellers did not include a link to pictures/timestamps of their device so it was hard to detriment what exactly they were selling in what condition.   


Ways to implement these suggestions:  
I think that the best possible way to keep the Supernote market safe and avoid blocking out other content in this subreddit is to create a new subreddit specifically for buying/selling/trading Supernote devices. This new subreddit would then be added to the USL (universal scammers list) and would have strict rules on how people can make posts. Any person who wanted to buy/sell a device could then make a post and the seller/buyer could sort these posts by new in the subreddit getting an up to date list of the resent buying/selling requests. Flairs could be added to further improve the process with Buying, Selling, and Closed tags being used to show the status of a post. Lastly, each post would be able to include pictures and a detailed title so that the buyer and seller can meet quickly and effectively.  


Thanks so much for reading our feedback! I hope this post is helpful. Thank you for sharing your opinion with us, to avoid scams and make our users can get a Supernote device through a trustful channel is our wishes. Hope our users can be more cautious and prudent during the transactions of a used device. What we can do is limited at this stage, look forward to a chance to discuss more with you in the future.

"I've had an issue with my Supernote A5 since I got it almost a year ago and I was wondering if anybody else had the same problem.

I cannot charge the device with a USB-C to USB-C cable. It works fine with the included USB-A to USB-C cable, and with any other A to C cable I've tried. But if the cable is USB-C on both ends (like the MacBook charger) absolutely nothing happens. I've tried this with multiple cables and multiple transformers with the same (lack of) results.

Does anyone else have this issue, or do I have a faulty device? This is frustrating because it means I need a dedicated charger for my Supernote, while the rest of my devices (laptop, phone, keyboard, etc) can all charge from the same cable. If it is a problem with the device, is there any way to get a fix or replacement? Bit surprised you haven't contacted CS if it's been happening for almost a year. I think there were a few customers who had problems with the included cable last year but it can't be that if you've tried multiple cables and chargers. 

Feedback to customer service, via your device, is your best course of action. There are the usual things to try, hard reset, swapping cable around, clean the port (but then you've got it to work with USB-A) etc or it could be a software fault. I'm sure they'll help you resolve your problem I was actually waiting until I got around to getting another cable and adapter to test it out before contacting customer service, and to make sure it wasn't just something about the the USB hardware they use.

I'll contact them, thanks.

I use my Supernote A5 for a lot of grading, and overall it works great for getting feedback to students. I don't use Google Classroom but I can speak to the other aspects of the workflow.

The workflow is a little awkward, however. It's easy enough to get a folder full of PDFs of the student submissions onto the device and to mark them up. But because the Supernote wants to leave the original PDF untouched, you need to export each marked-up document individually (as far as I know there is no way to export an entire folder in one action). This takes usually betweeen 5 and 30 seconds per document depending on its length, which interrupts the grading flow a bit. The exported files are in a totally different directory, named the same as the original document. I usually end up manually copying these files somewhere to be uploaded back to my LMS.

I would **love** it if they implemented an ""export entire folder"" option, or else if there were some way to have the exporting of marked-up PDFs happen automatically in the background.

There might be a smoother workflow with Word .docx files if you get an X-series Supernote.

Still, the Supernote has made marking up student papers and essays *much* easier overall. I no longer need to either (a) print them all out or (b) fiddle with PDF markup on my computer.

Hope this helps a bit! Thank you. This definitely helps! How do your students feel about your comments? Are they able to see and read them easily? Aside from my bad handwriting, yes!

The annotations are a bit pixelated but nobody seems to have had an issue yet. Also, I think the pixelation issue has been solved on the X-series with vector-based exports (which is allegedly coming to the A5 … *eventually*?)",Question about use with Google Classroom/Drive,title prediction
" Hi! Since this morning I’m having a problem when trying to update my a5x, and some more issue. When I try to update it (I’m still at 238 version), through settings&gt;system&gt;software update&gt;check, it just tells me the device is updated. Wifi connection, of course, is on, and I can check my email, but I cannot synchronize though supernote cloud, because when I try, it immediately opens the last doc I read. And finally, if I try to upload the log (system&gt;feedback&gt;upload logs), it tells me “upload failed”. I restart and reboot 3 times, and no variations. Please, give me some indications about what I’m supposed to do. Thanks It should've updated around two weeks ago. My advice is to contact customer service via email and include your device number.

" Thanks a lot! Very good video as always :) I agree with you, it may be missing an option to choose the type of eraser but anyway we will enjoy it ! Just have to be patient for the ""X"" owners. I'm using the 5X this morning, and really miss the erase gesture already! lol Could you tell us if this gesture is possible to execute while holding the device in one hand and writing with the other? Or are you forced to put down the device on your lap or table? I wonder if this specific use case was a part of the troubleshooting when Supernote developed this gesture, u/mulan_sn or u/hex2asc? I've been trying to imitate the gesture on my A6X, but find it a bit difficult to find a natural/working way for two fingers to touch while holding the device in my left hand and the pen in my right hand. The whole premise of the two finger gesture suggests that you have a free hand available in the first place but it's *not impossible* to get two fingers on the screen using the hand holding the device. 

However, as stated from your own trial, it's really awkward and very uncomfortable to get the finger positioning right to successfully activate the function. 

The developers have done a lot of work to refine the gesture and activation zones to prevent as much accidental or false positive activation as possible due to extra stray fingers on the screen including the writing hand making contact with the screen while writing.",Supernote A5 and A6 UPDATE!

"I was just eagerly waiting for my Supernote to be shipped. The long waiting time is not great but is something I understood but I had to cancel my order 3 days before shipping since I looked randomly into the return policy.  Not free return policy and good will return for such devices is just not what I expect. Do you by any chance live in the US?

I read complaints about a lack of free international returns but tbh that's not the norm where I live and, I think, a lot of the world... so calling it *a joke* is a bit harsh and a little US (and maybe EU?)-centric. If I bought a Remarkable, for example, their free return policy wouldn't apply to me since I live in Asia. I guess I would wait for them to set up US/EU warehouses for cheaper shipping in your case.

Edit: The only places I know of here with free international returns are big companies like Lazada (owned by Alibaba; think Amazon) that do logistics in massive volume. How long does this company take to ship? I ordered my A6 X four days ago and have yet to receive a confirmation email. I have only gotten the PayPal receipt. I know they are supposed to have good customer service, but I would at least like to know that my order is being processed. Usually ships within a few days and as far as I remember they sent me a despatch email ( though that doesn't always mean the parcel is physically with the carrier.) I do remember that the tracking was slow to update. See whether anything comes through by Monday then pop them an email to check. Could be they're just busy. Appreciate that we'd all like a free return. However, some people buy it just to try it out, some order at least two devices from different companies with the sole intention of only keeping one. They are a relatively new company, so if a lot of people send devices back, they're losing money. Perhaps, one day they'll be in a position to but likely it could increase the cost for others.

There is the option of selling it, as others have done.

Method 1: Then click the PDF on the cloud page, it will automatically download the exported PDF after clicking and converting (with the .mark files)   
  
Please do not download from the cloud directly without the above steps, otherwise, it is possibly to download the original “blank” pdf without annotations.  
   
Method 2: You can also open/click the exported pdf with annotation from the My device-&gt; Export folders, (The exported pdf will be downloaded automatically)  
  
Additionally，when exporting the PDF on the device, whether you choose “original” or “Vector”. For a vector pdf, If the pdf parsing software cannot open it ( or open without annotation), please try to open it directly with a browser.  
Not sure that whether it is clear enough, please try it. It worked - Thank you!!

Mike I don't have my device yet - it's currently in transit from China. So I can't help you with the first couple. But the pen is not magnetic. They recommend you use the case because it has the pen holder loop on the side for it. 

And as far as I know, the Kindle app only lets you connect to the Kindle service. I'm *pretty sure* you have to use the built in reader to read epub and pdf files you transfer to the device. 1- You don't need the Kindle app to view ebooks. Kindle app is only for accessing kindle books. Supernote can read most ebook formats. Edit: To use LAN, you need the Supernote Partner App.

2- You can put those files anywhere. But the ideal place to do it is in the Documents folder. Putting them in the Notes folder may cause some confusion.

3- Check your email or spam for a privacy or insecure connection alert to enable it.

4- No. You can keep the cap in the pen loop. If you have the standard pen and not HOM, it will be roomy in the pen loop. Many thanks.

Don't suppose you know why the USB won't connect? It seems I can write to the supernote cloud drive and then sync.

"Hello

I have supernote A5x and A6x. I need the two devices to have the same content.

I'm logged in on both devices with the same account (email address). They are not mirroring. on the ratta supernote cloud, it only shows the A6x's content

I've tried to log out and log in on A5x: doesn't work... 

what do I have to do ? Curious about this question myself.  Thinking of getting an A6X for the smaller form factor.  But if they are treated as completely discrete devices and there are no seamless integration options, despite them sharing the same email account, why not consider a non-Sn as a second device just for variety? X series can share the same account(login with one account), while the non-X series can share the same account. You can log in on your new device with your existing Supernote account.  
  
Users need to be careful to keep both devices in sync with each other. Generally, the steps are like following:  
1: A6X writes notes  
2: A6X  sync  
3：A5X sync  
4: A5X writes notes again.  
.......  
Repeat the above steps

I second this. I have an A6X and A5X and they sync with each other fine. Same for me. I have A5X and A6X, and the content syncs fine.

Re Google. Sure it's been mentioned/requested, so believe it'll be possibility in a future update but don't take this as gospel. I work with two devices A5x and A6x, and they can be synced if you what entails correspond to your needs:

1. **Sync is manual, and therefore, not real time**. That means that when you do a change on your device you need to do **every time** you want to use ""collaborative"" documents.
   1. press the sync button on the top drawer, to check if any change has been made since the last sync by someone else
   2. make the changes you need to do
   3. press again the sync button to make sure what on the cloud mirror the content of your device
   4. hoping that no one is doing the same on another device (see 3 below)
2. **Sync does sync the notes but not the ""smart annotation""**. See here point 3, on my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/nnr2nv/do_annotations_exist_outside_my_a5x_or_a6x_device/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). If that's what you need upvote the post linked.
3. **Sync granularity is the file level**, I think, but unsure. I, personally, notice that if I want to sync two devices at the same time, there is an alert on the second one, saying that the cloud is already busy syncing on another device. **What I fear it means is that** : during the time device A is syncing (making some useful changes; let's say to your task list), you can't sync. Then, when the cloud is done syncing A, you start syncing your device B. If, for some reason, the changes you made to the task list on device B is ulterior to the one made on device A, that (probably) means, you'll overwrite changes made by device A, **losing device A changes**.

Based on these remarks, and the fact that you have a team of 8 people (imagine this hassle is x8), **I would recommend going for a device that as a granularity of stroke change, and is in ""real time""**.

If you want to stay in e-inks, I would therefore recommend looking **Mobiscribe Origin: MobiShare**. Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/K35CFZlKC9M) testing the sharing capabilities.

"Thank you for the new firmware update. It adds some very useful features.

Is there any way that you could add pressure sensitivity adjustment/calibration in a future update? I have several styli which I find more comfortable than the Supernote stylus and the default pressure sensitivity is far too high for them. 

Also, in a previous firmware version, the button on a Lamy EMR stylus triggered the selection erase tool when held down. It now does nothing. Can this be re-instated as it was a very useful feature? The eraser on other styli still works fine.

"Since A6X is on Android, I *supposed* we can install Microsoft OneNote app, and take notes directly into MS OneNote.  Supernote, can you please comment if this is possible? Yes, As it's an Android device, you may do that. But you have to wait a few months. At the beginning, we will block any third-party APP until A6X runs stability.

And I should inform you that handwriting latency will increase by using OneNote. Because of slow refresh rate of E Ink Screen, Supernote's note app access the display layer directly. We call this EPA technology (EPaper Accelerator) while OneNote does nothing special for that.

We will not exclude attempts to install third-party applications, and we will establish an application store to encourage users to help us collect applications suitable for ink screens.

For us, our main goal is to develop note-taking application, which needs to be adapted to the disadvantages of gray scale display, low refresh rate and so on. It should perform better than other apps while runs on E Ink Device.

So I think you will have opportunity to try both solutions, from MS or from ours. :) Hi Bruce!

Thanks for the transparent insight :) I agree about your view about the technology and the consumer demands and I hope that your decision will pay off.

One of my concerns with Android as an OS of choice is the latency. Can you say that there will be no decrease in latency (even better, an improvement) with using Android? (The EPA tech sounds great!)

Also, as it is an Android-based software, is it okay to expect some basic functionalities as Web browser, keyboard pairing, etc?

I am really happy that your company is very communicative. Can't wait to join the fam! (would be super cool if you'd have a EU warehouse ;) ) Appreciate the communication and transparency in this.  :)

Perhaps another way for me would be to OCR it in A6X's note taking app, and then export it to OneNote then. This is a good idea!  If we plan to export doc/docx format, why not add one more format as OneNote. We will check that if we can do.",Will A6X be able to sync to Microsoft OneNote?,title prediction
"Is there a reason that Supernote have sent 8 emails about their A6X pre-order offer in the last 30 minutes? There doesn’t appear to be an option to unsubscribe either, which is a bit naughty these days?

Personally, although I really do want to get a Supernote A6X , I’m not going to pre-order anything until I see something a bit more concrete than some screen shots. Not the most thought-out piece of sales literature. Where are the specs, has the latency improved, what are the differences between A6 and A6X...... anything?!  Eight emails,  It's very high treatment. I think they see you as a big buyer. :) We should say sorry, It seems they send everyone 8 emails... It's our mistake.

"Anyone else feel that they are really missing the ability to search for a specific word in their handwritten notes?

I primarily would use this device to take meeting notes. That is the reason Im holding back from buying at this point. SUPERNOTE doesn't have the ability to search hand written notes at this time. However the A6X migth have the ability when it comes out but for mi used I think is too small I need the A5 with that fuction. I really think that constraint is that they don't have OCR readily on their Linux OS (on the other hand, it's one of the main features of the Remarkable). As a consequence, one cannot really map the handwriting to the alphabets for searching..

Prolly also that the software is originally introduced in Chinese/Japanese, so English support is minimal.

Maybe Android will change things as there are lots existing solutions out there. Let's see =) But do you personally feel that you need to search through your notes sometimes? Of course! It's also on my wish list as well. But I could imagine it not being on the top of their priority especially the introduction of the new OS.

"Was quite interested in getting an A5 but was really put off by the fact that there is no way of returning an opened device. I have bought devices in the past that might have worked well for others but just didn't suit me. And so, in less than a few days, they were returned. Given that there is no place for me to try the device, I think it's pretty unfortunate there is no return option. I understand they are a small company that's just starting out but I'd also have been okay if they charged a restocking fee. 

How do you guys feel about their no return policy? Just wanted some different perspectives. I understand your concerns. Our marketing department will internally discuss the return policy in order to better serve our users, especially those early customers who find us. Thank you very much for kind understanding.

As for return policy, we assume Supernote buyers are familiar with E-paper device and operation system and here are reasons we put the policy.

Some customers had impulse buy with less consideration of the need they really want. We would like to avoid such lose-lose result.

We have been suffering by free return policy for some surprising reasons, such as

\- The display size is too small or too big

\- No color display

\- Just dislike it anymore

\- Need some cash back urgent for other

Please understand that we provide one-year warranty with free replacement and DHL delivery for obvious malfunctions or defects as a responsibility to customers, but we cannot afford for nonsense return. We fully understand that most customers are reasonable and kind, but things keep happening. We are a young company doing all we can to improve our product for people's daily lives.

We know this is never a cheap purchase so we appreciate every customer who places order and uses Supernote to make daily life more efficient and meaningful as our 4F slogan: Feel &amp; Find, Free &amp; Fun. It’s not great, especially when they are expecting customers to purchase, at least at the moment, based on a “goodwill” policy, in that there is hardly any info at all available on the A6X. 
I dunno about anyone else, but I would always try and get as much info as possible on something that was going to cost me several hundreds of pounds, but that info isn’t available. I really do understand that there will be timewasters, people who don’t like the colour, etc, but you’d like to think those were in the minority. The point made about a restocking fee seems fair, perhaps something along the lines of even half the purchase price, so it would sting if you sent it back,(for non-defect reasons, obviously ), but wouldn’t be a complete loss for either side?
I’m waiting for two things before purchasing the A6X, one is more information, videos, specs etc and the other is a European distributor so I don’t end up having to pay a third of the price in shipping and taxes! That's a really disappointing reply that I think you copy/pasted from somewhere else in this thread or your website (so no real discussion?). I have mentioned maybe even instituting a restocking fee to discourage frivolous returns from customers. You haven't addressed that. None of the examples you mentioned (why people return devices) capture the writing experience, that's the one thing we can't test by watching videos. ""the no returns due to a small percentage of potentially bad customers"" approach doesn't reciprocate the goodwill you seem to be expecting from your customers. 

Anyhow, you guys are allowed to run your company however you think is best and I wish you all the best for that.",No returns on opened devices?,title prediction

" Thanks, good share.  I understand Mandarin (Chinese) so here are some takeaways:

Looks like there are some interface changes on the tool bar and also the way the notes are displayed.

10:40 - The Lamy pen feels the same as the 1st generation heart of metal pen (Plastic nib). The reviewer said there's a bit of ""stickiness"" feeling when writing.  He feels that the 2nd generation ceramic nib feels better when writing. 

12:20 - He was comparing the Weixin ebook reading app, I think.  He mentioned the speed seems to be comparable with another ebook reader and looks nice.  Chinese Font on the A6X seems to be smaller and doesn't seem to have a setting to change that in the Chinese ebook reader app he is using.  

13:37 - He mentioned the writing experience is quite good.  Will be continuing further reviews as he uses the A6X in the coming weeks. Thanks so much! I received one. 
I can do a quick video if that helps.

Can confirm the stickiness of the Lamy nib, don’t have ceramic to compare. 

Shout your questions and I’ll answer :) Thanks! :)  Can you please share your experience of the ebook reading?  Things I'm looking at:

\- Table of content

\- Annotations: is it easy (just write directly?)

\- Can you export annotations easily?

\- Can you still draw a line across the screen and then do note taking split screen?

\- Press-and-hold on a word for dictionary (is it available yet)?

"I have a Onyx Boox with note taking from work, but the A6X appeals to me.  However, I've found it very hard to make pencil-like sketches due to the lack of pressure sensitivity to opacity on the Onyx.  Though the brush gets thinner with low pressure, it's still 100% pure black.

Most of the first pre-orders have been shipped and many customers in Japan, China, Europe and the U.S. have already received the A6 X. We look forward to you sharing your creations on the A6 X!

1. The region selection edit tool affects the erasing effect.

2. Margins are too large (EPUB)

3. Confusion caused by two different entrances, the right tag bar and the file manager.

Personally, I want to have one of those eink device to take notes at work, read epub pdf and blogs. So the only think really missing on A5 is the browser.

Any thoughts on that?

For the A5, it is harder to integrate a browser, but out of concern for our users, we will try out as many solutions as possible, without guaranteeing results. If the browser is crucial to you, ""X"" series could be a better option at this stage.

"Hi, I've just updated my A6X with the C.063 firmware. Thank you for the correction on the selection tool after the erasing action. It works. 😊

I wanted to tell you I found the following bugs:

- Eraser: with the previous version, when I chosed the ""region eraser"" or used the eraser on the Lamy pen I could delete just a part of a continuos stroke, just the area I selected. With the update I can only erase a complete stroke, even if I select just a part of it. And if I choose the ""regular eraser"" I cannot change its thickness, even if I go to ""pen"", change its thickness and then ""regular eraser"", it is always small.

- Folders: I still find the confusion we had on the previous version, but now I know that if I want to see the files stored in a folder I have to use the side bar, go to Inbox and then select the folder I need. It would be just great if I could see my files even if I choose for example ""Documents"" or ""Notes"" on the side bar and then select the correct folder.

- Png: I don't know why, but when I select a png file, the device tells me ""Unsupported file format"". I can see the thumbnail, but can't open it. It happened also with the previous version.

I know you are working hard on further updates, so maybe you are able to add some of these amendments.
And thank you for this amazing device! Hey there,

Thank you for your detailed feedback.

Eraser: To improve user-friendliness, we are optimizing the region erasing algorithm for a smarter approach.

Folders: in this release we have only tweaked the UI to reduce confusion and will bring subsequent improvements in later updates.

One option to go around this problem is to use the star mark. You basically draw a star on a page and the device recognizes it. After, you can search for star marks in any note document you have and it will display small sized pages where you have a star. Therefore, if you underline some important keyword on a page with one of these marks, you can find that word with no problem. So it's still better than a regular paper notebook. Also consider that you don't have to use paper or carry tons of notebooks with you. Everything is in one device. It is fast, good to write on, and everything is tidy and accessible.
I have been using A5 device everyday for roughly a month now. I use it as a notebook and (mostly) as a PDF reader. Besides the very good writing experience, fast processing, etc., the best part is that I don't use paper anymore and everything is cleaned and organized from the beginning. I would recommend it.
That being said, if you really need a handwritten notes conversion function and don't want to tackle the problem by the means that supernote offers, there may be other devices on the market more suitable for you. Yes, we have the same idea as you. So we made a similar function in A6X. My colleague will post a video later, please confirm if this is what you want.

Once this function is approved by our users, we will apply it to A5/A6. Hi there, you can convert your handwriting to text and set it to keywords for easy searching and indexing.

"Do you guys think that this would be possible? I use OneNote for **a lot** of things and it would be so awesome if SuperNote could sync with them. :-)

I thought of this after my integration with Dropbox completely broke on my A5. Maybe another idea would be to add more slots for quick access? I keep a lot of my notebooks separate and having more than 4 items in the quick access bar would be a gamechanger for me. If this feature comes through Supernote would make an immediate impact on the professionals market (potentially grabbing a chunk of it from iPad). I see OneNote used in the industry a lot, yet very few who use it write up the notes on iPad. In my area we use ordinary notebooks and then retype the notes in OneNote (it is considered unprofessional to type notes in a customer meeting). If I had this sync - that would be the feature I'd be using hte most.  


The key thing though - it should support the corporate sharepoint accounts somehow (OneNote can use sharepoint as the sync backend). Completely agree! None of these devices have that functionality so it would really cater to a very specific target market. Posted this sometime back.  They replied:

"I have had a Supernote A5 for close to two months now, and overall I love it. It has changed the way I work and has made me much more productive.

 However I have been surprised at the poor quality of the images in exported notes. It seems like they export as raster images at the same resolution as the Supernote screen. When I view them on a larger, higher-resolution computer screen the lines look very jagged and pixelated, and zooming in on a note makes this worse (see the attached doodle).

Is there a reason that Supernote does not export to PDF with a vector-based image, like I believe the reMarkable does? I believe this would help the notes look much more legible and clear when read on a computer.

"I wish to use one for home and another for work, but would like both to sync from the same Dropbox account.

I mainly use notes and would like notes to sync on both devices. Interesting question. How do you think the sync should work? My understanding of the sync process is that it doesnt sync unless i explicitly pulldown then top nav bar and hit the sync button.

So, for simplicitly/Minimum Viable Product, i think they should let the end users control sync i.e. if there is a sync conflict (i.e server file updated by another device), they provide the option to a) retain file on device, overwrite on server (cloud) b) retain file on server, overwrite on device. Yes,you can.
And one more thing need to know is that  a6x is trying a new note file format which differently with ""none x"" series(A5,A6). So if you sync one of A5/A6 type with another of A6X type. Each one would fail to open the note file created by another.

"Just got the A6X today and I have to say that as a person who much prefers pen over pencil, it is really nice to write with. I've had the rM1 for about 4 months now and here's my initial thoughts comparing the two. (Background - I'm part designer and researcher and I make things with my hands so I'm very sensitive to the tools I use)

Screen - I thought that the A6X's 300dpi screen would mean that the lines I write would be less pixelated and smoother-looking than the 226dpi of the rM tablet but that's not the case. 

Size - I thought the smaller 7.8"" diagonal screen size would feel like I'm losing out on screen real estate. I don't feel that way because of the finer tip on the pen. The size is more portable than the rM dimensions and I feel like I can take it everywhere with me.

Pen - It's a comfortable weight to write with. The style reminds me of the Pilot Razor Point felt tip pen that I used to use a lot. The finer nib and the feeling that I can press as hard as I need to is mentally relieving. I did not realize how hard I write until I've switched back to pen and paper after using the rM1. The standard rM1 marker feels to me like trying to write with a hollow plastic tube. I also have the LAMY AL-Star and that feels too bulky for my medium-large hand with skinny long fingers. Sometimes when I press the button on it a short line appears out of nowhere on the rM1. I don't have any mods on my rM1.

Writing feel - Wow. Everyone's been saying it's hard to describe. Here's my attempt. My go-to paper for writing is very smooth, about 25% of the way to glossy paper, and I usually use the Muji retractable pen, the one that looks like the Sarasa retractable pen, 0.5mm. It's a ballpoint. Compared to that, writing on the A6X is like if the ballpoint is not rolling, but instead it's gliding. The sound of writing is quieter than the rM, which is quieter than pen on paper. It sounds like you're writing on paper with a smooth paper texture, but that's if you're writing with a light hand. The harder you press down, you'll get less of that scratchy sound. When you first put the pen to the A6X screen, you'll hear a tap sound kind of like Apple Pencil on iPad but quieter. It's louder if you're holding the pen at an angle, and quieter if you're writing on it such that the pen is tangent to the surface (or orthogonal or uhhh straight down for the laymen terms). The rubber texture provides more resistance the harder you press when writing. If you press too hard, it's a lot of friction. But that means that you get more haptic feedback if you're going slow and trying to be precise in your lines. If you're pressing hard and want to write fast, it's gonna feel like too much friction. On that note, I can see the indent of the lines on the screen surface when I write hard and it quickly disappears. So that's good. 

Colors - the A6X has 4 colors. White, light gray, dark gray, and black. I don't see myself using the white one very much. Compared to the rM1 which has white, gray, and black (and light gray for highlighter), this means that I can use the A6X for planning website layouts. Light gray would be content boxes and then darker gray can be non-text content. I would fill in actual content with black. 

Switching between tools - It's nice that it's only one tap to switch to the highlighter or marker(?) on the A6X. On the rM1, this requires two taps and then reading from the list to pick what you want to use. Unless you've got the positions all memorized. For me, this means that it is faster to write headings and highlight important content so that I can structure my notes clearly and visually. 

Interface and some features - It's not as obvious how to get to the Settings menu like on the rM interface. You have to know to swipe down from the top and the mini tutorial at the beginning does not cover that. I love the lasso select text as a heading for a table of contents. That way, I don't have to look through the pages to find what I'm looking for. Compared to the rM1, this means that I will not have to create a new notebook for each topic or subtopic. I can just select the text to be a header. 

Cover - I got the default cover. The front cover feels a bit too lightweight and it wiggles around easily. I can see where the round magnet is on the inside of the front cover, which is not a problem. 

Questions - 

1. I'm trying to sync with Dropbox. There's no new folder on my Dropbox or I can't find it. Do I need to have a Supernote account for this to work? I'm hoping I don't need that. 

2. I'd like to use the nib in a different pen chassis. I was able to unscrew the front piece near the tip but can't seem to get the nib out. Can I even do that with this updated ceramic version?

3. I made a test notebook that's just 2 pages of scribbles. Why is it 2MB? I like that it does tell me how big the file is but I imagine if I have 100 pages, it may be 100MB. So about 2000 pages would be 1GB. So the 22GB of user space I have on the A6X would give me like 44,000 pages. Much less than the rM's advertised 100,000 pages on 8GB. 3. I wrote about the file size as well and the support team replied saying that they will fix that issue in future updates. They said that they are well aware of the issue and they have a potential fix that will be part of one of the future updates. 
Hopefully that future update will be before you reach the 44,000 page limit? Lol just kidding 😅 

Enjoy your A6X, I think its a marvelous tool with an equally amazing &amp; very active team behind it. Cheers. Thanks! Glad they’re going to fix the issue. 

I quite enjoy it so far, much more than I have enjoyed my rM1 in the past months. I think I may have found the right one for me. To read your notes in Dropbox, first export them als pdf or png.

"Had a quick question-what type of charger is recommended for charging my A6X to have better battery life. I read in Onyx Boox posts that fast charging was causing lot of battery issues. 

Is it ok to charge my A6X with a fast charger? Or should it be a small charger? Or a computer perhaps (as the package did come just with a cable and no plug 🔌) 

Want to keep my Supernote for ever 😁 A6X support USBPD (the main fast charge standard). It's a negotiation protocol. When plugged, the charger will ask A6X, ""how much current you want?"", and A6X always answer,""1.5A is enough"". So the charger will start supply current limited by the agreement. You need not worry about too much current would damage the device. Typically A6X will get full charged in 2 hours by a 7.5W (or more powerful) PD charger. 

If you want to use a fast charger, please make sure it's PD type.

It's also ok if you use a computer USB port for charge, it will take more time than PD charger, at about 3-6 hours. Because of computer USB port usually limit the current supply at 0.5A-1A level. Perfect explanation! Thank you",Type of Charger to Use,title prediction
"Hi! Question for the supernote team, after the holidays. 

Are any of the following features on the roadmap? (I understand the hardware roadmap is delayed for bug squashing and UI integration across devices, so it could be a while, but would love to know if they’re at least in the works or in planning.)

1. Frontlight (ability to set brightness at the least, ideally also warmth)
2. Waterproof/water resistant

3. Work with calibre wirelessly* (content server or companion app)


* actually, as I’m still having trouble getting my A5 set up to work with my PC at all via usb cable, I’m not 100% sure it works with the calibre desktop software that way. Does it? If not, that’s definitely a feature request, too.  


Thanks! Our holiday is coming to an end, but I have been on duty during the holiday

1. About the front-light.

When the E Ink screen was first put on the market, it was necessary to add an auxiliary light source due to the low contrast. However, the current contrast gets better and does not require front-light. In products whose main purpose is note-taking, removing the front-light is a common way.

However, some brands with a history of making eReaders continue to use front-light. The reason is that it can be used in places without lights, such as at night. My question is why not turn on the lamp?

Our focus is on a good handwriting experience, writing on a shiny screen will not be an enjoyable experience. 

We use the ""hard pen and soft film"" technology to simulate the effect of paper. If the front-light layer is added, the distance from the pen tip to the display layer will increase. So we would rather give up the front-light feature.

2. About waterproofing

We will not use waterproofing on the ""X"" series (A5X/A6X), but we will consider supporting waterproofing on the successor products of the ""non-X"" series

3. About USB

If you use MAC PC, you need to install the software openMTP to support USB connection. If it's not cause by this, please contact our customer service. Thanks for another quick and thorough reply. I’m consistently impressed by your presence in this subreddit.

1. I sometimes like to work and to read in bed while my spouse is asleep. That said, yes, I could leave the bedroom or perhaps use a smaller external book light. That’s a great point about adding a light lessening the writing experience.

2. Interesting, thanks!

3. It’s a laptop running Windows 10. I’ll do a bit more troubleshooting on my end and then reach out if I still can’t figure it out.

Thank you again. I enjoy this work because I like to communicate with others, especially for interesting idea to make product better. Another reason is I want to improve my English skill since I'm from the place where the mother language isn't English.

I'm happy to learn a new phrase ""reach out"" from your message.

So don't be hesitate to reach out with any question:) &gt;Our focus is on a good handwriting experience, writing on a shiny screen will not be an enjoyable experience.

I totally understand this, but the device can \*also\* be used for reading: and improving the reading experience in low light setting can be nice, don't you think so? It would also improve the perceived contrast of the screen (that's the magic behind the ""paperwhite"").

Eink screens did improve, but the background is still kinda grey. With an optimal lighting and a document with good contrast it's fine, but if that's not the case a frontlight can help. A lot. If it can be shut down, what problem would it create? Is the distance to the display layer so big that the writing experience would be really different?

"My boss was enamored enough of my A6X to buy one for herself, and for her birthday I got her a Heart of Metal pen.  She loves it, so here's a review:

""The pen is STURDY.  I don't feel like the cap is going to pop off if I drop it.  It makes a solid ""click"" when snapping it back on and I love that it's thicker than the standard pen because I prefer writing with wider barreled instruments.  It writes just as perfectly as the standard pen.  No charging required.  I don't know how long the nib will last but the packaging included easy instructions for changing it and I've had the standard for months without any degradation so I don't expect to be changing it any time soon.   Fits snugly on the case's loop and I don't worry about it coming off in my bag."" 

So obviously she gives it 5 stars, lol!  I'll be buying one for myself eventually if I get tired of the LAMY one. Totally agree; I also have the HoM pen, bought it along my A5. It solves the problem I had with my previous eink notepad; as an university student, I write a lot and the nibs would wear off way too fast. Now I can write probably till the end of the world :D So happy.

"I just got both of these delivered today I was in batch 3 for the remarkable 2

Here are my observations as a notebook doodler. I wanted a device that I could take outside and do some sketching and people studies and just generally be able to do rough logo concepts and first stage illustration layouts, like I usually do in my paper notebook. I am a biro scribbler rather than pencils so... here are my observations.

Surface feel - the biggie :) well remarkable has this won hands down. You start drawing on this and you just smile. Man it really does feel and sound like you are drawing on paper. It is absolutely incredible. The supernote definitely doesn’t feel like paper it feels like writing on rubber or a piece of Lino with a biro, as you press harder you can feel the pen almost carving into the surface. It doesn’t feel bad but it definitely doesn’t feel like paper. So if you are just looking for the most realistic paper feel then go get the remarkable 2

Drawing experience - the remarkable 2 has a large range of pens pencils and a brush. The supernote only has three  - fine liner, the pen (pressure sensitive), and the marker. The remarkable brushes all differ in the types of marks that they create and I have not yet found an absolute favourite but the brush seems very versatile lots of variation between thick and thin strokes and the biro mimics it’s real life counterpart rather well. The pencil is ok and uses tilt for shading but for some reason you can only choose one colour (black). 

Due to the smaller selection on the supernote the choice is pretty easy the pen works the best for me due to the pressure sensitivity and mimics fairly well the results that I get when I am sketching with a biro, I usually use lighter (thinner) strokes for initial forms and then lay down harder (thicker) stroke for final forms this technique also works well here. I hope that supernote include more ‘pens’ soon. I would love a brush that lets you lay down thicker strokes to make full use of the pressure sensitivity. The stylus sensitivity and lag on both are very good, perhaps the remarkable edges it here, but the supernote is very very good too.

Colours (greys) - the remarkable includes only three shades for their ‘pens’ - black, mid grey and white - with the exception of the pencil which as mentioned is only available in black. There is also a highlighter which lays down a lighter grey which is handy. It is also worth mentioning that the highlighter is translucent rather than opaque so you can still see your artwork behind it and the colour gets darker as you lay down subsequent strokes (like a real world marker pen) The supernote includes four colours for each tool - black, dark grey, light grey and white, but doesn’t include a translucent highlighter.

Erasing - where the supernote definitely outshines the remarkable 2 is in its erasing capabilities which you wouldn’t think would be a big thing, but it kinda is. I find it very difficult to see the eraser line on the remarkable and you only see what you have erased when you finish your stroke, so you’re never quite sure what the result is going to be, there seems to be quite a bit of trial and error as to how much of the stroke is erased, which is annoying if you are trying to erase precisely for highlights etc. If you are just using one layer then you can ‘erase’ using a white colour for any of the pens, but if you want to put a shadow layer beneath your main artwork then it kinda messes everything up because you have white opaque ink on the layer above. Supernote on the other hand nails this, the eraser works the same as the brushes, it erases instantly so you can be very precise. Obviously in real life you don’t have multiple layers in your paper notebook but thought it was worth mentioning.

Screen refresh - the remarkable leaves quite noticeable ghosting behind on darker inked areas when you close the tool sub palettes, and I don’t think it’s possible to do a manual screen refresh, although switching a layer visibility off and on seems to do the trick. I haven’t encountered these issues on the supernote but if I did you can swipe up on the sidebar to refresh the screen which is nice.

Size and portability - the remarkable is about the same size as an A4 piece of paper. So the equivalent of an open a5 notepad which is what I usually have in front of me in front of my keyboard when I’m working, so it’s a nice size, to scribble down some sketches or client notes when at work. The supernote may be a little small to jot down a lot of notes or sketches and it is not currently possible to zoom in to the canvas, but is absolutely ideal to pop in your bag and do some al fresco doodling. Another thing to note is that the remarkable 2 has a landscape mode but the supernote doesn’t. So if you are drawing in landscape orientation the toolbar is rotated 90 degrees

Overall feel - I preordered my remarkable 2 and just got the vanilla options so standard pen and sleeve only. So that cost around USD399 plus shipping The supernote a6x was USD 369 plus shipping but the real kick in the pants was the 20% extra you pay on import taxes. So these two devices were practically the same price. 

But when you handle them the remarkable feels like a luxury item and the supernote feels like a fun friendly gadget. I wouldn’t think twice about throwing the supernote in my bag and whipping it out to do some urban sketching, but the remarkable 2 feels a lot more precious and feels like it would be a lot more conspicuous in public places

From a pure sketching point of view it’s difficult to choose between the two. The pen performance on both is equally as good. The sheer size and paper feel make the remarkable great for cracking out development sketches and making  longer form notes at home or the office. The only thing putting a dampener on the experience is the eraser functionality. The size of the supernote makes it very portable and great for urban sketching, single sketches, and shorter notes/lists.

I’m enjoying them both and not sure which will get most use but I have a feeling that I’ll take the supernote everywhere with me, and use the remarkable primarily at my desk or on the sofa.

In summary

Remarkable 2

===========

\+ feels like writing on paper

\+ Premium feeling/looking product

\+ Pen performance is great

\+ Landscape mode

Eraser isn’t very good

Some screen refresh artefacts

Maybe a little conspicuous for urban sketching

Supernote a6x

===========

\+ Great size for urban sketching

\+ Free folio cover and pen

\+ Pen performance is great

\+ More shades of grey to choose from

\+ Eraser works well

Feels like biro on rubber not paper

Fewer tool to choose from

No zoom

No landscape mode

Maybe too small for development sketches or extensive notes

Hope that helps any doodlers out there Thank you for bringing a so fair and so detailed comparison.

After I read it carefully, I will follow your article from the role of product participant. This is such a great review. Very detailed. I especially agree with you on the size of the A6x. I find myself bringing it everywhere with me because of its size. Great review!

Another point I notice about the Supernote. The bottom end of the pressure curve has no opacity pressure. Only size. So the stroke gets smaller, and then just stops at a certain pressure activation.

On Remarkable, a light touch with the pen has a slight opacity falloff, like a real pen. The pencil even more so. So you can get a lighter half-textured stroke.

But even the Remarkable pen pressure curve doesn’t go to zero. It snaps off at a certain pressure. So if you try and draw an extremely light line, it snaps on and off like a dashed line.

I’d love if both these tablets had a complete drop off to zero on the pressure curve. It would make drawing much better. But with Remarkable, it has a slight edge because it has a bit of opacity falloff too.

Both feel nice though, and I enjoy drawing and writing on both.

Also, sometimes I use the Remarkable stylus on the Supernote. The plastic nib glides very nicely over the rubbery surface! And the stylus is lighter than the Heart of Metal stylus, so it’s a bit easier on my wrist after a while.  Supernote was originally designed for note-taking, so we made HoM into the same shape and weight as a traditional pen.

But when it comes to art, the lighter the better. So we're going to make a special pencil for the artist. It can also be used in other situations. And compatible with all Supernote tablets. This pen will be the default accessory for A5 SLIM, but users can purchase it separately.

"I haven't ordered an A6X yet,  was really hoping for an A5X soon.  I was wondering it anyone is able to test the Trello app for functionality and if it doesn't work is life to put in s request for it. Hello, thank you for your information, we have recorded your request. Could you please describe your use case? I am an engineering consultant. I create buckets for each of my clients and then create cards for each project I'm working on. Inside the cards I add notes from calls, task lists, setup a timeline that gets added to a calendar, etc. Once a project is done I will move the card to Client-Archive bucket. I would suggest you look at getting a regular tablet, like an iPad with a paperly screen protector instead to get a paper-like feel. I don't think this device or other eInk devices can properly support that work flow.

If you want just a Kanban board I'd understand. You could definitely draw up a Kanban template. But a fully functional Trello is excessive for these types of devices. 

Additionally, Trello doesn't support handwriting, so you would be typing everything out anyways, which will be a way slower experience due to eInk. 

Take Onyx Boox for example. They just use fully open android so you can install anything you want. But the performance of the app won't be any good for it. Since they have no control over a third party-apps, nothing can be done other than wait for an upgraded model that can handle it.

"After updating to the most recent A5 software here are some of my thoughts about the changes made to the top menu bar for note taking.

Moving the page number display position in notes to the top menu bar to prevent accidental touches was a definite improvement for my daily workflow. However I feel that the user interface design of the top menu bar still needs a bit more refinement, as I have now lost easy access to a lot of my regularly used menu items such as share &amp; export, templates, and quick access.

I think too much unnecessary space is being taken up by the note/document title (50% or more of the screen width) and the page navigation. By reducing the size of the space and decreasing the font size of the text for the titles, I think at least 3 or 4 of the other more commonly used menu items can be restored to the primary top menu instead of being relegated to the secondary drop down menu list instead.

Curious to know others opinions on the new top menu redesign for the A5. Which menu items do you often use that are now part of the secondary menu options (ooo)? 

Is there any way to customise which menu items are more important for inclusion in the primary top menu by prioritising the items in the same way that tag menu items are ordered in the settings menu?

As always thanks for the regular updates and feedback on questions and issues posted by users. Malcsweb, have you tried to simply double tap anywhere on the screen to hide all menus?  This gives you full screen real a state for writing or document viewing. Thanks but the issue is not about trying to hide menus for writing/reading but suggesting to get rid of empty white space in the title and page navigation section of the NEW top menu to make room for more menu options that used to be there previously. Thank you for your thoughts, this is very helpful. What do you think about the user interaction design of the A6 X? We have piloted a new user interface on the A6 X. The top menu has been redesigned based on the frequency with which users access different menu items. We are still working on this interface and plan to unify the A5, A6 Agile and A6 X once it is complete. Thanks Supernote\_official. Haven't seen the A6X design in detail but from what you described I like the idea of top menu items based on frequency of use. Look forward to seeing this feature in future updates.

1. I have never used the Kindle app before and I don t quite understand it.

I also find out that you can buy kindle books for 3rd party shops. I am not interested in the market aspect of it, because there are not many books in my language on their platform, but is there a reason to choose the kindle library over the default Supernote library (the tablet's interface itself)?

2. I just found out about the titling feature of the tablet, but can I use it for PDF s text (lasso -&gt; transform into title)? If not, how could I insert titles that could be recognized by the tablet if we are talking about a PDF that I created? 

3. Because I didn t find a solution to the .2 question, I am using bookmarks. Can i change the ""title"" of the bookmark? Long press doesn t work.

4. I just saw that .word format is available (I don t know if it was available before) and that a lot of functions were implemented for it, especially the zoom function. I was quite sad that I can t zoom in my PDFs, but I found out about the trimming feature for the PDFs files. This is like a zoom, right? Does it have another function?

1. kindle app is used to read the ebooks only from kindle store. 

2. We support the handwriting title to make the note file structured and indexable. because many user's note increased to dozens of pages, they need a easy way locate the page quickly. We will not support this feature on PDF/DOC. Because PDF/DOC has own methods such as cross-reference, you can jump to the page from the cross-reference.

"Just following up with a question I saw someone else had. A major use case for me to buy into an e-ink note taking device is to be able to skip a step when taking notes. The conversion of my handwritten notes to text that I can eventually turn into more coherent documents. Is handwriting to text in the pipeline for implementation? It's a fashion. But according to our test, handwriting recognition will limit the fun and freedom of notes, and even slow down the writing speed (in order to ensure the recognition rate). So we will support this feature, but the priority is not high. And handwriting recognition will first be applied in some partial features, such as keyword recognition, and the text insertion in the doc revision function that will be released in the next update. The function of ""entire handwriting recognition and import into DOC/TXT"" will be implemented at the end.

This is not a technical problem, but a difference in product concepts. That's good to know it is something that can be implemented. Thank you for actually responding, even if I am disappointed in the answer.

But wouldn't that improve the functionality and fun of a note taking device? I don't think it has to be done simultaneously, but if I'm using the supernote  to take notes during an interview, a meeting, or a lecture, which seems like a pretty common use-case, it would so helpful to be able to export my handwritten notes afterwards into a text document. I don't think it has to be live. It could even be something you schedule to do when the device isn't being used. It would add a practical element to something that is fun! 

For example. As part of an ideation process, I could be brainstorming something on my device, have it exported to an md, docx, or txt file, share with a colleague for feedback, and then I could review/annotate it back on my device. It would just eliminate a step of doing a manual conversion!

If it isn't a technical problem, you could implement it in a way that fits with your intentions for the devices. But if Nova and other note-taking eink/tablet can do it, its a bit unfortunate this one chooses not to. Especially when your devices seem to offer such good features in other ways! It seems like the devices are so close to what I want, and I may still buy one, but not having this available in the foreseeable future is a reason not to jump in, yet.

Either way, thanks again for replying and being transparent, even if I don't agree. Until I can justify a device, I wish the team continued success! If you output TXT/DOC in a calm environment, you will find the keyboard is the most efficient.  If you take notes in interviews or meetings, you will find that your writing needs to keep up with other people's speeches, which leads to scribbling.  Some sketches are even mixed in to make the description more intuitive.  These all increase the difficulty of identification.  If you have really used similar software, you will find that the effect may not be as good as you think.  We are not opposed to full text recognition.  We just tend to accumulate some assistive technology and then do this.  For example, how to distinguish between sketches and characters. Because once we start to do this, we must ensure that it is really effective, not just a marketing video in an ideal state. Yes indeed a keyboard would be more efficient, but for many reasons, not always viable. Hence a note-taking device can fill the need. It's good point that hand notes tend to also include sketches or special characters, like those in mathematical equations or flow charts or cluster maps. It is reassuring that it seems that there is a focus on delivering a clever bit of software as the goal. However, you did say earlier that it wasn't technically difficult. So now I'm confused.

Either way, it seems this functionality will be added, perhaps more in the future, but when it does, I think your software and products will become a lot more attractive to people like me, or academics, analysts, jotters, or creatives. The original point of my question was whether it was in the roadmap of functionality. I'm glad to see it is, disappointed it isn't as much of a priority, so now I'm hoping that when it does become a feature, that it was worth the wait",Handwriting to text,title prediction
"Hello guys! I'm wondering if A6X can handle pdfs (scanned books) well. I'm a bit worried about the screen size. I heard there's crop function but is that enough to read small texts?

How's your experience?

(p.s. eagerly waiting for the A5X) I am reading now on some material that I wrote in Times New Roman 12, double spaced, and with the crop function it s good. It was readable even without the crop function (I discovered it later).

The only part that I don t like about the crop function is the fact that it takes the ""note space"" away, but I believe you can ""\[ \]"" and make notes inside that - look into the user manual for this. 0:46 - PDF articles.

"It would be wonderful to be able to borrow free ebooks from my public library right from A5. I know other linux based e-reader devices can do this, e.g. Kobo.  I wonder if other A5 users would like this feature?  And....Is there any chance that Ratta engineers can integrate Overdrive or Libby into the A5 platform. OverDrive seems only support  ios/android. So you may get other resource, such as gutenberg project.  [https://www.gutenberg.org/](https://www.gutenberg.org/)  You may download the ebooks from the website and than transfer to your A5. Thank you hex2asc.  I appreciate your prompt reply.  I will try this.  

But, please allow me to ask another question.  I am not a programmer, so my knowledge is very limited in this area.  And I probably don’t know that I don’t know.   Nevertheless, when I was researching e-ink tablets, I selected the A5 because of the stability of Linux OS, which runs my wonderful A5.  I understand that Kobo e-readers also run on Linux.  How can they incorporate Overdrive, and not the A5 if hey are both on the same platform?  Is it because e-readers are fundamentally different from e-ink tablets? You like to ask why, which makes me have to check the usage of OverDrive.

I found that Kobo has developed an interface specifically for OverDrive, so Kobo can directly connect to OverDrive to browse and read eBooks. But for other eReaders, there will be some complexity, Users need to install the software ADE (Adobe Digital Editions) on PC/Mac . We can to vist the OverDrive website by PC browser, and then download the eBook, and then transfer the book to the e-reader.

We have not tried to connect to ADE,  we will learn more and try. I am grateful that you looked into it and even considering the request.  Best wishes.",Feature request: Overdrive on the the Linux A5 platform.,title prediction
"Is A6X more abrasive than Oynx on the pen? If I use the same pen (Lamy Al Star) on both of them, will the nib wear be the same? I am not sure about the nib wear, but i believe the nib you would use on both devices are different. Due to the surface coating on the A6X, the nib is harder compare to the nib you would use for Onyx.  


So if you do reuse a pen between the two devices, you would have to swap nibs before using. Thanks for the answer. Is it possible just to buy the nib for A6X from somewhere? Supernote devices have a built in screen protector that is much more pliable than Onyx (or any other e ink device).  The pen that comes with Supernote devices has a ceramic tip that never needs to be replaced.  It can only be used with Supernote devices - if you use it on any other type of device it will scratch the surface.

You can also get an upgraded package from Supernote that includes a Lamy Al Star EMR.  The nib on that is plastic and will need to be replaced.  Because the Supernote screen is more pliable than other devices, it's possible that nibs will last longer when used on that device versus other ones.

I purchased the A6X with the stock pen (ceramic nib) and it works great.  I also have a Lamy - but I use reMarkable nibs in it.  The stock Lamy nib on the Supernote felt too slippery.  The reMarkable nibs work great and have a better writing feel in my opinion.

I also have the Noris Digital Jumbo, and absolutely love the writing feel of that on the A6X.  I usually switch between the Noris and Lamy because I love both of them.

Based on a recent video from Voja ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgj5Y7NHY74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgj5Y7NHY74)) about the best pen and nib combinations for e ink devices, I have ordered the Samsung Tab S6 Lite pen and  HP ZBOOK X2 nibs.  Can't wait for those to come in.  On a side note, I also can't wait to order an A5X :D I had an Onyx Boox Max 3 and sent it back. Now I have a Supernote A6X. The A6X is far better than the Max 3 for the writing feel with the Lamy pen (with lamy standard nibs). The Supernote Pen is better than the Boox pen too.

"I use the Scribd app for ebooks and audiobooks. It is a service that is dying for an ereader but alas there isn't one. A partnership between Scribd and Supernote would be innovative! Copy that. Partnerships are both good and bad. How many devices do we  buy with preloaded applications we never wanted and can never get rid of? 

Is okay to offer it, but also allow the customer to delete it. The last thing Supernote needs is a application to Scribd that can never be removed by the customer.

Example, I dislike Facebook and never use it. But I can't uninstall it from my Samsung Note 9. I can turn it off, but it's always there. Very good points, I totally agree. I agree. I like the Kindle app on Supernote A6X - it works great on the e-ink screen and provides an option to read purchased books on an already excellent note taking device.

Having Scribd would provide a 'Netflix for books' like option to supplement Kindle's traditional book buying option and, for me, would complete the e-ink device experience.

I agree with another poster that too many apps would be cumbersome and detract from Supernote's streamlined user experience. If someone wants unlimited flexibility to download apps, Likebook and Onyx are options. I'm happy they picked Kindle and stuck with it instead of adding Kobo and Play Books and all the other alternatives. (I'd similarly be fine if they had picked a different store front - too many choices weigh down the user interface. Better to have one and stick with it.)

"Would it be possible to have a tools menu accessible in full screen mode? I like full screen for writing, but it is annoying to have to exit full screen to pull up the tool bar. Yes, a floating tool bar/bubble is comming in near update. Any chance of getting the A5 functionality of double tapping to go in and out of full screen? In the early design, we used a lot of hidden interactive functions. For example, double-click to enter/exit the full screen. Swipe from the side to the center of the screen to call the writing toolbar. Long press the file name to enter file delete/move/copy operations, etc. These designs make the interface more concise, but also cause some side effects. Most users will not read the user manual carefully (of course I do too), and they will complain if they don't know what to do. So in the later design, we try to avoid hiding functions, but it may be overkill.

" I know the Ratta team has a lot on their plates but hopefully this is something that can  be addressed in future software updates. I think both the rM and Supernote look as unclean as they do because of how note-taking on the devices themselves is the main selling point, and so to the creators of these eNote devices, export comes after that. Not saying that the exports should not look crisp, but it bears repeating what the primary intention of each device is to help understand where these young products stand. As for whether or not they're dealbreakers is up to the consumer.

In addition, Onyx Boox products tend to be somewhere in-between eNote and a full-blown eInk Android device, which is why they have the best of both worlds for software.

"After searching high and low, did you know, not a single note taking device or application offers hand recognition spelling checking. Not a single one.

If the device or application can do OCR for hand writing, then it could also spell check too. Normally OCR keeps some index of the words written to search against. That index could also be scanned against a dictionary. If the word is not found in the dictionary, the device or application could highlight or tag the word as misspelled. It's up to the developers of the tool offers spelling options or corrections.

I've put the same challenge to Goodnotes application team for the iPad. As I said, no one offers this feature yet. 

So depending if Supernote or Goodnotes implements first, then that's what I'm going with. My needs are simple, OCR for text search and spell checking. I posted before I finished. For OCR the possibilities really multiply. With standard text you can offer translation services.

Also, some people love writing notes, but they don't like their handwriting. So if you introduced OCR with font replacement, you can help those folks make beautiful notes. Write a word, and OCR picks up the word, and then replaces the word with nice font

Ratta might think of selling add-ons too. So everything I mentioned could be an additional extra folks could buy /unlock. No different that Goodnotes / Notability or other note taking apps.

If the difference between having full OCR with search and spelling check is extra $40, then that is worth it to me.

I hate subscriptions though. Have you checked out MyScript Nebo? I use it for long form writing (just straight up writing text, no drawings). It's on android and iOS and can convert your handwriting to text as you write. Just double-tap to convert. And it's easy to edit the text that's already been converted. Your handwriting style does not get saved. 

It can then export the text to different formats or other apps. I like to use it with Day One which is awesome for journaling. 

Doing long form writing on the Supernote feels like a lot of handwritten text that I have to review and type out if I want to make any good use of it. We have 3 goals

1 Make the note orgnized by original handwriting titles that can help user locate the page quickly. like ""table of contents"" of MS DocX.  Without any recognition. This is more free, you can set anything as titile, words, symbols,etc...

2 Can modify the DocX by handwriting. 

3 Can recogination entie page of handwring smartly(Able to distinguish between text and sketches) and output to Text/MarkDown/DocX.

"I was wondering if Supernote has any plans to support RemNote in X series (as RemNote is available as an android app) (see \[1\] below for further details on RemNote).

I think it would be quite useful to have an advanced note-management app (like RemNote, Obsidian, Roam research, Insight, etc) available in supernote directly; among these, RemNote is free and has an android app (btw I'm not affiliated with RemNote or anything, I just find it extremely efficient. See \[2\] for my use case).

I'm not sure whether this is a niche use case or whether there are a lot of supernote esers who would use this if it was available, so I'd appreciate if the community chimes in. Also, I'm tagging u/hex2asc : I'd appreciate if the Chief Chat Officer informs us to if there is any such plan :)  
\------

\[1\] For those who do not know, RemNote is a ""note-taking"" platform/app. It uses science-backed methods to ensure efficient learning (such as spaced-repetition, bi-directional linking, flashcards, etc).   Please see [https://www.remnote.io](https://www.remnote.io) for further details. There are several such platforms (RemNote in my opinion is most balakned, and is also free), for a nice comparison see these youtube videos [https://youtu.be/M2U61vHfQSQ](https://youtu.be/M2U61vHfQSQ) , [https://youtu.be/opSENgc45Sw](https://youtu.be/opSENgc45Sw) .

\[2\] I'm a PhD student in physics, and I use RemNote regularly to take both my academic notes and my daily scribbles . I  do not own a supernote right now, but I'll be buying a5x ---actually I would buy it right now while it is discounted but unfortunately I'm currently not in US and will not be back till the end of next month. I plan to use supernote to read papers (mostly arxiv stuff). I would definitely use this if it were available. I am not sure how feasible it would be though without the addition of an external keyboard. Part of the beauty of Remnote is how quickly one can enter and arrange data with keyboard shortcuts. But maybe I'm just too used to using it on my laptop to envision a new implementation.

Now, if only there were a way to have all of Remnote's features in a handwriting app then I would be in pure bliss. 🤗 I have to admin that I don't know RemNote or similar types of tools.  
My question here is how much RemNote needs web connection and ""intelligence"" from other places to organize/restructure information.

I think one of the main positive features of Supernote is that is focused on note taking, it can be used offline and you can choose when you need to go online or USB-connect to transfer/synchronise your stuff.  
To be too much dependent on external engines or tools (if this is something RemNOte requires) is not something I see as a positive path for Supernote, but of course this is a personal and quite limited point of view from myself :-) The poor CCO does not know much.

"Hi, I see with pleasure that Supernote is working hard to support editing functionalities for digital formats (i.e. Word .docx).

I have to admit that I'm not using them a lot now, but I'd like to ask here why the .docx format and if Supernote is planning to have a more general and standard approach to this.

Word is a proprietary tool and .docx is a not-so-great standard for text document (I don't use MSOffice and I use the standard .odt format, supported by LibreOffice, OpenOffice... for text documents).

What I'm thinking is whether simpler plain text formats could be supported as a more standard and interoperable basis to transform digital notes.  
I think that simple .txt files would be the first step, but an open and widely implemented and supported structured text format as Markdown ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)) would be an ideal solution.

I can see (dreaming) simple signs (short line or asterisks) for writing bullet points or identifying headers in the notes or ways to reference other notes (internal links). You already have some functions transforming manual input into structured commands (e.g. the square brackets or the stars for notes, the insert or flip command in the Word files) so it seems to me a natural evolution for more advanced functions.

I think that having a plain text format like Markdown supported could allow to have multiple types of export from it (.docx, .odt, .rst, simple .txt) and it can be well connected also with (future implementations of?) text recognition and transformation from manual notes to structured text.

Anyway, this is just food for thought... :-)

Ale I would personally love that feature! I do remember reading on this reddit that Mzrkdown support is planned. Text and MarkDown will be support. It’s in plan.

I find them both very comfortable to hold. The Lamy might be better for controlling the pen when trying to do precise work and it's lighter than the Heart of Metal. However, it probably comes down to personal preference. If you have access to a regular Lamy pen, the experience will be similar if you want to test it against a typical metal executive type pen that the Heart of Metal emulates.

The ceramic nib on the new Heart of Metal pens ensures that you won't have to worry about replacing nibs as they wear out. 

Personally, I like them both and alternate between them. The Lamy will also work on other EMR enabled screens like some Chromebooks and tablets. The ceramic nib on the Heart of Metal is hard so shouldn't be used with a device other than the supernote.

If you do a fair bit of drawing, then the Lamy might be the better pick. If you mostly take notes, I think that the Heart of Metal has the overall edge. I watched your guide and thought it was very good. I've watched many of your in-depth reviews and rely on them for choosing e-ink devices.

I would comment that I was surprised at the lower rating for Precision that you gave the Lamy (7/10) - not a bad rating - but in my experience, I found its precision to be very good and more comparable to the top of the group.

I was also surprised at the higher rating for the Samsung. It's a better pen than the standard Boox, but I didn't see it as anything special - too thin for my taste, round unlike the Staedler, and I didn't like the feel of the soft nib at all.

Otherwise, I agree with your ratings. 

Thanks for the guide! Thank you! You've been very helpful!",Difference between AL-star EMR and the other styluses,title prediction
"Hello all
I just figured out some of the basic yet powerful features needed on the the Supernote devices.

The pdf experience on the supernote is not bad, but some of  functionalities on it would make it great for any kind of document format...

1. Landscape mode for pdf documents.
2. Crop Features including the article mode support 
3. Gesture for bringing up the table of contents.
4. Insert clipart / image while taking notes.
5. Pinch to zoom in and out the content.

These features would make even the smaller A6x fully functional.

2. I will forward it to PM.
3. In kindle device, we can tap the top area to call the TOC. But in Supernote, we must filter the tap when writing. So can we call the TOC from sidebar?
4. In plan, but not start
5. Is developing. Awesome...
Thank you for the kind response
Really love the device and the writing feel on it
But yeah some times I feel adding functionalities would make the device even more better...

Looks like a lot of new features are on the map and really looking forward to see them on my A6X.

Reg.2 I mean TOC while reading pdf textbooks and not on the notes app.
And yeah if it is possible to call the TOC through the sidebar it would be handy and neat.
I have some ideas but not sure if it is possible to implement them on the device.
1. In a document -&gt; In the full screen mode (I mean *only when double tapped on a document to get rid of all the UI elements) - the sidebar when swiped up  instead of showing the regular app navigation menus it would be great if it shows TOC and as uasual manual refresh when swiped down. 
On exit (I mean again double tap) brings everything to the normal way as usual as it is at the moment...
(OR)
Atleast an option to manually set what the swipe up side bar does in which TOC is an option.

2. Two finger swipe on screen from left to right to bring up the TOC in a box covering half the screen is also an option...",Manditory Functionalities needed on the Supernote devices,title prediction
"I really like how responsive and supportive the Supernote team is, especially on Reddit. It's great to see they consider the user experience and feedback. A little while ago someone posted something and a rep from the team made a comment like 'we hadn't thought of that, it's an interesting idea'. I think this type of feedback system is great!

However, I feel a lot of people post on this sub with a kind of 'all or nothing' slant - like if 'Supernote doesn't do X, then I'm not buying!' It""s fine, it's a forum, it's up to you to make your line in the sand somewhere. But, why are some people writing so absolutely? I think if we have feedback or suggestions, it would probably be most effective written with examples or justification or use-case scenarios. I know I'd be more inclined to listen to well-explained ideas rather than ultimatums. 

Alas, just some boxing day venting. Cheers y'all You should see r/remarkabletablet if you think this is bad... Not comparable.
Remarkable support does not respond, it is normal that ppl go absolute in that case. Supernote read every single line and answers.
The point is not ""it is bad"", the point is ""it has no sense to write with this tone."", as far as I understand. Yeah, in general I agree. A lot of people are kinda taking the teams responsiveness for granted.

Here are just a few examples:  

* ""I've put the same challenge to Goodnotes application team..."" ""My needs are simple""
* ""Mandatory functionalities needed""
* ""Why are you not supporting""

As much as I love the teams responsiveness, I do feel some people have been quite harsh in their wording when making requests.

Personally I'd rather the team improve what they already have, before adding more work to their plate and bloating the system. I've always seen Supernote to be a minimalist alternative to other devices simply for ""note-taking"".

I guess some people want stuff with all the bells &amp; whistles like:

* E-reader with pdfs, news, books, and probably even websites.
* E-writer with every single text format.

Which is pretty much the Onyx Boox. Which is not minimalist or lightweight. I'd personally rather a tool that does one job, and one job well. To jump off of the last sentence:

As useful as the kindle update is, I'm very excited for the improvements they're making with their native writing software (e.g. pencil brush and Word editing). They're consistently refining the ""mobile office"" idea with each update, and I'm glad to see that they take the time to put in additional stuff but only as secondary or supportive of the ""mobile office"" theme. Hopefully in the next update or the one after it, they have some improvements for the native pdf reader for markup and export.

"I had my A6x for a few months now, but today was the first time I had to transfer some files to it from my phone.  I tried to pair it, but I keep getting nowhere.  I tried initiating pairing from the phone and A6x with same results.

Basically the two devices see each other, both pop up a pin screen and both have a pair button.  When I click pair button on A6x a keyboard pops up, which I assume is to enter the pin.  When I enter the pin it kicks me back out of the bluetooth settings screen. The two appear to be briefly connected, but then connection is lost.  Any clue what's going on.

If it matters I have a Google Pixel 4 that works fine with my other bluetooth devices. We think that the Bluetooth transmission rate is low, so we did not use it to transfer files. And only use it to support Bluetooth keyboards and Bluetooth speakers. It will failed to connect to other devices. But we should give tips for other connections that are not supported. Clear information should be given instead of letting users guess what happened. This is our mistake. We will fix it as soon as possible.

If you transfer files from a mobile phone, it is recommended to use cloud synchronization. You can use Supernote Cloud or Dropbox. You can also use Wifi-Direct to transmit directly (it needs to be on the same WIFI network, sometimes it is not stable). Both of these methods require you to install the Supernote Parter App or Dropbox App on your phone. Is there any update on the super note app not functioning for the last few months?

1) How long does it take to ship? I live in California.

2) Is there a desktop app? If so, can I create a note in the desktop app or is it simply importing/exporting? The reason I ask is because my work prevents me from using cloud services due to security reasons. I was hoping I could import screenshots from my work computer and place it in a note on the A6X via USB.

3) How frequent are you guys recharging your device?

TIA!! Hello.

1. About the ship... It took me 7 days aprox to come to Spain. But I paid €150 of taxes...
2. Nope. Only the Browser version of supernote's app. But you can configure dropbox. The only problem is you cannot see notes in dropbox. You must export first to PDF or JPG from your A6X.
3. It depends, it can last 1 week if you use it for hours. For me is about 2 - 3 weeks of light use because I'm not that busy right now.

Anytime! 1) West Coast here. Bought it on Christmas, got shipped on the 28th, and received it on the 31st. So 3 or 6 days, depending on how you measure it.

3) I charged it once in the time I've had it, though it's about to need another one. 2. I find even though I sync to Dropbox, I don’t review my notes on devices other than the Supernote itself.

"Hi! A very happy user of A6X here. I had a feature request. 

Currently the name of a new note is basically the timestamp without spaces. I do want dates as the name of the notes, but I would like the option to make it more readable so I don't have to change it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason and explanation:

* I find using the keyboard and renaming a notes doc every time I create one tedious, and the current timestamp one is not as readable
* Mostly I end up just adding spaces/dashes to make it more like yyyy-MM-dd-timstamp format, so would be great if say the device could give option what the default name is. 
   * Some options could be
      * yyyy-MM-dd &lt;day of week&gt; i.e. 2021-01-05 Tuesday
      * yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss i.e. 2021-01-05 12:00:00
      * yyyy MMM dd i.e. 2021 Jan 05
      * and many more
   * In case of duplicates, the notes can always append (count) to differentiate. Eg: ""2021-01-05 (1)"" if another file with the same name exists After seeing your suggestion, I immediately understood why I always thought the default file name was strange before.

"Hey... Just ordered A5X and have a few questions.

I have a sizeable Zotero library 6000+ pdfs that I currently sync to my BOOX via Google drive and an app (autosync). This works pretty well as Zotero automatically names the pdf files with author-year-title, and search is quick enough on BOOX to bring up the thing I need in a couple of seconds. I can then annotate and save, the annotated version gets automatically synced back to my laptop.

What I want to know is - does dropbox sync on Supernote automatically keep in sync? How well will Supernote handle that many PDFs in terms of search speed? And, will annotations be backed up straight to Dropbox/laptop?

Cheers! How are you using Zotero as a pdf library? :O Annotations are backed up to drop box as a separate .mark file. So you’ll have the original unedited .pdf, plus a .mark with annotations. 

You have to export or use the supernote companion app if you want new pdfs that have the annotations integrated. Zotero works really well to organise pdfs - you can drag/drop a pdf onto the main window and it will usually find the metadata for it (better than other reference managers I've used). The trick for getting pdfs easily available on mobile is to use the extension 'zotfile' which will rename the pdf and move it from Zotero's own labyrinth directory structure into one big directory that you can sync with Google Drive/Dropbox. Also, the browser addon for Zotero is great for taking html snapshots of webpages - these come out really well on Boox devices (I don't know about other ereaders) as text-resizable books.

The annoyance on Boox (as with Android tablets/phones) is there is no way to push changes to the Google drive folder to the device, so you have to use a third party app that you manually sync or set it to look at time intervals. This works, but just not very efficient.

There is an android app - zoo for zotero - that's really well made and can link to the synced folder to open pdf attachments. The problem is that when you have a lot of pdfs it can be very slow to open the pdf. Maybe down the line a version for Supernote could be great. Ah, thanks for the info. That should work fine for my needs. In some ways it is better to keep the version in my Zotero library clean from my scribbles anyway and it is good to have a separate place for marked up versions to know what's been read, maybe.","Zotero, Dropbox sync and search capabilities A5X",title prediction

an Idea I had, since kindle is its own aplication would be adding a small memo pad on the top pull down menu, that way taking quick notes from kindle (or any future apps might be possible) within the app. I dont know how feasible it is to make the app and note function work at the same time.

another thing I was thinking which I dont know if it is already a setting or not since I could not find it, is displaying the residence or contact info at the lock screen, in the case the tablet gets lost.

currently If I loose my device, whoever finds it would need to unlock it, go to the menu, find account information and then contact me.

"Hi Supernoters, I have a question.  

I am on the A5.  I have a note page that I use to document and track my billable hours for consulting services.  For ease of documentation of my consulting hours, I linked this page under [Quick access].  That note file now is now 37 pages long, and grows weekly.  Every time I go to [Quick access] and open this this note file, it opens by default to the first page.  I then have to jump to the last page to add new hours.  Is there a way to have Supernote to open (by default) the last page that was opened?  Has someone found a workaround?  If not, then can the last paged opened in a note page be the default when accessing a note file from [Quick access]?

Thanks Tats a neat idea. Could definitely see how that is useful. On drawboard there is a little symbol that lets you jump back to the start of the previous  'timestamp' like when you first started a chapter or something. It would be cool to have Great suggestion.

"Hello Supernote,

I’ve pre-ordered the 5x and am excited to start using it!  I’ve been watching videos on it and noticed you changed the ‘create’ button so that instead of instantly creating a new note, you now have to choose whether you want to add a note or a Word document. 

I think many of us will rarely (if ever) create a Word document as we have purchased this device primarily for making hand written notes. 

Can you please either move the Word document creation to another location, or only show that option after a long tap-and-hold, etc. so that a regular tap on the ‘plus’ icon will simply create a note?

I plan to create dozens of notes per day so this would make the experience much more pleasant. 

Thanks for considering. Agreed Your suggestion make sense. We will change it soon.

Thank you very much. Thanks very much! Agreed too!! I dont really need the word document creation function so readily. Perhaps place that option in the document folder? Thanks so much to the supernote team! I feel theyve been so innovative :)",Return to single-tap note creation,title prediction
"Hi everyone,

1.  I saw something posted here a while ago about choosing a server, but I can no longer find it.  I created my account on the Supernote A5x and enabled sync.  Upon logging into the cloud in my browser I accidentally clicked the China location, not realizing I couldnt switch afterwards.  Is there any way to switch server location after the fact?  Is there an option on the physical device I may not be seeing?

2.  I was testing things out, creating notes and playing around with the features.  I hit the sync button to upload what I have, went to the server website, and all I can see are the folders Ive created.  No notes show up at all, only the one screenshot I took.  Any information on this?

3.  Is there an export/save as pdf option yet?  I saw the post from a while back that it was coming but I havent seen any updates on it so far.

Thanks in advance for any help! Re. 1, paging /u/hex2asc.

For 2, have you actually selected the folders you want to sync? It doesn't default to syncing anything and might just be showing you a skeleton directory structure.

For 3, hit the 3 dots -&gt; Export -&gt; PDF, or do you mean proper vector export? For 2.  How do I select which folders to sync?  Long press, check them, then hit sync from the drop down?

3.  I figured that one out, just what I needed it to do.  Edited my original post.

Thank you for your help! So you need to go back into settings, go into sync, and click the right arrow to choose folders. You can choose a folder by checking it or enter the folder by tapping it (say you only want to sync a subdirectory -- as an example, I sync a directory called Personal but not Work).

If the folder chooser doesn't show up, it's a software glitch -- rebooting (in the settings too) will fix it. I see the arrow, and all of my folders are checked off",Questions about syncing and other things.,title prediction

"Hey, so I'm upgrading my trusty old kindle keyboard ereader and I really really like the look of the supernote devices. They just look much nicer than boox in my opinion. I love the aesthetic, the nicer pens, the nicer cases etc.

One of the huge reasons to upgrade my old kindle is to get a Glow light. At the moment I use a clip on light that is a faff. I know supernote devices currently don't have lights but will they in the future? Is it worth me waiting to see if they get one?

My second question is will super note support apps/apks so I can borrow books from my local library? Here in the UK most library's use BorrowBox which has an Android app. The second most popular library app is Libby. Will Supernote make these two apps available?

Thanks Very much doubt they'll ever have a light, it requires more space between the pen and the screen which makes writing feel funny. I think it's unlikely you'll see such niche apps supported but I don't know their full plans with regards to app support. It kinda seems like you're looking for a different device than what supernote is trying to be, the target is note taking as a top priority. Yeah fair enough, thanks for the feedback. I'm also an app developer and would love to make some eink friendly apps so I guess the boox or likebook devices are the ones for me. I just thought the supernote looked so much nicer! I saw an old comment of a user that suggested a folio with an integrated light. That would be a perfect solution in my opinion.
You have it if you want to, don't have it if you don't want. While waiting for mine to arrive I've been thinking about some of the things I'd like to see added (like Libby/Overdrive)... but I'm also thinking about how difficult the Ratta situation is.

"From what I have understood there is no charger shipped with the device.  
I wanted to ask the following  
a)Does the supernote support fast chargers  
b)What type of chargers does Ratta recommend for the supernote? I mean how many Amphere Here's a comment from hex2asc on A6X charge:
&gt; A6X support USBPD (the main fast charge standard). It's a negotiation protocol. When plugged, the charger will ask A6X, ""how much current you want?"", and A6X always answer,""1.5A is enough"". So the charger will start supply current limited by the agreement. You need not worry about too much current would damage the device. Typically A6X will get full charged in 2 hours by a 7.5W (or more powerful) PD charger.
&gt;
&gt; If you want to use a fast charger, please make sure it's PD type.
&gt; 
&gt; It's also ok if you use a computer USB port for charge, it will take more time than PD charger, at about 3-6 hours. Because of computer USB port usually limit the current supply at 0.5A-1A level.

"Hi,  


I have been deliberating between the Remarkable 2 and Supernote A6x for a while.

I was just about to order the A6x but I saw a lot of people having battery issues. The Remarkable lacks a lot of features against the A6x but the battery is way more superior, it seems.  This is disappointing since rm2 has a 3000 mAh battery vs A6x is smaller with a 2900 mAh battery.

  
However, there have been some latest software updates (one of the 12 days ago) on the A6x and the release notes contains some changes to battery performance. What is the exact status about battery issues right now? If battery is a big deal for me, should I go for rm2 instead? I own both . I cannot recommend the rm2 honestly . Get the a6x or the a5x , stylus is better , more accurate ( never have misalignment issues like I do on the rm2)( no expensive nib replacements ) . Supernote developers are doing fixes and implementing useful and important  features ( have already experienced a few myself ) , where as all the updates on rm2 have been trivial and haven’t really added to the ( already barebones) utility.  I use my a6x many times throughout the day I maybe charge it ever 2 days . The great thing is I charge it with a USB c charger and it charges very quickly , battery is of no concern here coming from someone who’s used it for more than a month now .  The biggest pain point with the rm2 is that you cannot simply plug it in and quickly drag and drop files . You have to use their apps and cloud and other silly workarounds . With the supernote it is just drag and drop , updates instantly . They have also mentioned fixes to help battery further . I recommend supernote Rm2 is also more expensive.

Charging once in two days is not so bad. But do you employ it for heavy use, like taking notes the entire day or something? Sometimes when I’m doing long drawing or long notes i charge every other day . When I’m just using it as a planner many days can go by . So, the weird battery bugs are probably fixed by now, but it still probably stands at somewhere like 6 hours of non-stop writing (from [MyDeepGuide](https://youtu.be/mB8fTVPH1cY?t=948)).

I personally think Supernote is superior simply because you don't need to pay multiple times for a new nib. Though Remarkable 2 and A6X are kind of a bad comparison since, A6X is much smaller. I've had the impression that both A5X and it's upcoming successor (intended to be released Q3 this year), will and are clearly much better than rM2.

Also from what I've heard, rM2 has terrible customer service.

Good question! I also have a rM2--ideally would be great to be able to continue a journal I started on rM2 over to SuperNote. Seems unlikely tho :( I did it by using PDF export.

"Just want to shout out that I got my first e-ink tablet - Supernote A5x! 

I've been thinking about getting one for more than a year, following the development of Sony and Remarkable, and after watching the review by Voja, decided to take a leap and got it.

Quite happy with the device so far, and am excited to find this community and that Supernote is actually seeking users' opinion here!

Happy writing! Agreed! Awesome device paired with amazing customer service and community! I just joined “the family” too, I love that everyone on here (including Ratta Supernote themselves) is so helpful! :) Me too - got mine yesterday and stayed up till 1am figuring out how to customise it and get my stuff on it. Love that Supernote is very active in interacting with the users! And it seems like they will have frequent upgrades.

"I got my A5X yesterday in the post and so far I am loving it!
I am having trouble syncing my Dropbox to the device though. I have connected to my account successfully, and Dropbox has registered that the supernote is connected. 
However when I go to select the folders I want to sync, it does not show my Dropbox folders, only the folders that are already on my device. I've tried rebooting/resetting like a previous post suggested but no luck. Am I missing a step somewhere?
Thanks in advance! I was playing with this last night, and discovered it would only sync folders that were put in the Supernote main folders. It looks like you can’t add folders to those main ones (which are documents, notes, mystyle etc.) To get the main supernote folders to sync you have to select them so they have a tick in the top left hand corner - then they appear in Dropbox) you can then move files into them.

"Morning Coach just posted a quick snapshot of 6 ways the Supernote A5X beats the reMarkable 2:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL3wJnqN2P0&amp;feature=youtu.be

I sent back the RM2 because it looked good but didn’t offer much functionality. Then I returned the Note Air had the opposite problem – bloated with apps and a complicated user interface that made work harder. 

Supernote A5X seems to solve both problems with refined apps built for purpose and a simple, streamlined interface to get things done without any headaches. I’d rather be working on a task than working out how to use the device. This video should be shown to everyone that loves remarkable 2 over other devices lol. Other than sketching, supernote can do everything remarkable can do, and BETTER Well... wait for his ""6 reasons to get Remarkable 2 over A5X"" video in a few days ;) Altho, as an owner of both, I am currently won over by the A5X (even tho I still really enjoy the ""feel"" of the rM2 device and writing when I pick it up and use it). The functionality of the A5X has won me over (love keywords), and not having to replace nibs! Since you have both devices, can you describe the writing experience of Supernote versus reMarkable? A lot of users have trouble describing writing on a Supernote. 

Also, which stylus do you have - the ceramic or the Lamy (I still have my Lamy which I loved using). Remarkable 2 has a ""scratchier"" free. Not in a bad way--in a good way. I guess the best analogy I've heard is: it feels like using a pencil on paper laying on a table or clipboard. It's feels like a harder surface, but again--not in a bad way. Frankly, I still feel like I might prefer it to the A5X feel--even tho the A5X feel is also very good. Yep, I know, maybe not the most helpful.

The A5X has a smoother/slicker feel... and it also depends upon which A5X pen you use. I have both the Heart of Metal and Lamy. The Lamy has a slight scratchier feel, because it's plastic. The HOM is very smooth (ceramic). In reality, the A5X and Remarkable are probably very similar in smoothness--but the Remarkable seems to have more friction/scratchiness due to the sound of its tip on its surface.

FWIW--even though I may enjoy the feel of the remarkable more, i like the sharpness of the A5X pens more. I feel like I can write cleaner/thinner lines on the A5X due to the different pen/surface (especially with the HOM).

As far as which A5X pen I prefer--I still don't know. When I switch to the Lamy, I think ""oohhhh yeah--I think this feels better"". But then I'll use that for awhile, and then switch back to the HOM, and think ""yep, I like the sharpness with this"". So, I guess--get them both if you can(!) I DO love the eraser button on the Lamy--extremely useful. And while I wish the design was a bit better (so I didnt have to find  and line up my finger with the erase button everytime I grab the Lamy), I still think the Lamy is great especially if you think you'll be erasing more than usual. The way I look at it--the Lamy is an eraser I bought that also has a built-in pen ;) And the HOM is for when I just want sharp lines and I'm not worried about making mistakes and/or needing to use the eraser much. The UI's erase function still works well with either one, so not a big deal--but the Lamy's eraser button is very convenient once you have it and get used to it.",Morning Coach lists 6 reasons why Supernote A5X beats reMarkable 2,title prediction
"Dull - but necessary question.  I'd like to use my supernote for both personal purposes and work and therefore do have some questions about how my data is used. There are quite a few users in here from Europe (where GDPR or UK GDPR is applicable).  I had a look at your privacy policy and note that it says that it's only applicable for mainland China.  There is also a statement which says, ""In principle, the personal information we collect and generate in China will be stored in China"" [https://supernote.com.cn/user/PrivacyPolicyEn.html](https://supernote.com.cn/user/PrivacyPolicyEn.html) However you will be processing data which is generated elsewhere and stored in your servers either in China or Amazon Japan.   Please can someone provide more transparency about what happens with our data.  It's worth looking at RM's privacy policy as it does at least contain more specific info about what happens to our data. I usually don t care about this stuff, my data being anyway sold in every part of the globe, but tag me when someone replies, because now I am curious as well. Well... if you're using this as a digital notebook, you're likely storing more than just basic identity info such as email or phone number (the typical data sold around the world). People may choose to store very sensitive information in their notes... if the data is not protected, that data could be exposed. Which is why I'm very leery of putting any sensitive data in my A5X until I have the ability to store in a different service such as Google Drive. Even then, I'm still not fully trusting enough to put sensitive data in this device :( Thank you for bringing this up - it's something very reasonable to ask. I have the same problem as you because I want to use these devices for work and some of the things I write or draw could eventually become IP. If the data gets in the wrong hands, it's pretty well known some Chinese companies can steal and not care about IP ownership laws.
I'm really encouraged by Ratta's responses on this subreddit so would be great to hear from them on this. This is very important!

There are two types of data that will transfer to the server

The first is cloud services

In order to comply with Chinese laws (all companies providing information services in China must set up servers in China. Apple is no exception). But this doen't matter with users outside of China. What we said,  ""In principle, the personal information we collect and generate in China will be stored in China"" is mainly for chinese users. Don't worry about that.

If you want to use Supernote cloud service, we strongly recommend  do not use a Chinese server. (Amazon Japanese server is now available, US server/EU server is coming soon). Otherwise, you can use Dropbox instead. I don’t need to confirm if you are not a Chinese user, because Chinese users cannot see this message (Reddit is blocked in China).

Anyway. The most thorough method, you can turn off the cloud service. Use USB data cable, U disk and other methods to transfer data with computer.

The second is the User Experience Project.

If you agree to participate in the User Experience Project, we will upload some logs. It is usually the performance info in some operation events, such as the time it takes to open the file, the data of battery consumption, and the related information when the fault occurs. We use these data to evaluate and improve performance. It will not be used for purposes not related to improving performance. We will list log types and uses in detail later and update on the website. You are right, We need transparency.

If we need more detailed information for special purposes, such as improving the rendering of handwriting. We will launch a special volunteer program, where participants can send samples of their non-privacy note files to our collection mailbox. We will not store such data in the log.

Anyway, you can refuse to participate in the User Experience Project to avoid uploading any information.

I want to say that your concerns are absolutely necessary.

I.e. when exporting a note as a pdf, it would be great if I could have supernote insert a margin around the note. 

This would be useful if one wished make notes on the exported note using something like Skim on the computer. It would also be useful if the notes are to be submitted to a marker, as the marker would have more space to write comments.

"Just wondering about a possible implementation of a way to rapidly switch between two apps - like ALT-TAB on a computer. At the moment if I want to switch between a note and a book I have to swipe the side bar, then tap on the thing I want. This is pretty good. 

But I just wonder if there could be an option in settings to remap an up-swipe from screen refresh to app-switch. This would make an make it a really quick way to move between two things. 

If this option was selected, the screen refresh function could be activated by an on-screen button in the toolbar. Similarly, if the user chose to keep swipe up to refresh, then the toolbar button could active the app switch.

Just a thought! Interested to hear what others think. I do also really like swipe up to refresh, but for me personally I think I would get more use from switching apps.

Also, the ability to wake the device with a swipe (up or down) would be a nice touch - I find myself trying to do this anyway! :) I think clicking the button to wake to sleep is enough for me, even on my Boox it’s the same thing.

As for the swipe up to switch apps, I like it how it is now (swipe up to refresh), I actually have the same gesture on my Boox. Given that the limited number of apps is visible on swipe down anyway, I find that enough to switch between apps/documents really quickly. I would like this as an option, too. Perhaps it could be an option for the swipe up, to change in settings? Much like the first iPad allowed the switch to be either screen lock or something else (was it mute?), depending on user preference. I hardly use the swipe up. I think it would be awesome to customize and have users choose what they want that action to be. Personally I would like it to open the last most recent note or file so I can quickly switch between two. This would be a neat addition.",Swipe up for rapid app switching (and wake from sleep),title prediction

"I have 6 custom templates... they appear in the device's MyStyle folder, but only 4 of the 6 appear in the Template-&gt;Customization selection screen. Also, there are 2 templates I initially added but then deleted. Everything looks fine on the SuperNote (Japanese) cloud server/website, as well. It's just the the template-&gt;Customization screen that is messed up (only shows some of the custom PNGs I added, and 2 that I deleted are still there).

Yes, I have rebooted--a couple times, and I have sync'd a few times. I also made sure the MyStyle folder was checkmarked in the sync settings.

So... help... More details... I've played with the filenames of the png/template files I uploaded. I made them shorter and removed periods from them. I now get 4 of the 6 templates in my Customization template pages, and the deleted ones are gone. So now, I'm missing 2 of the 6. Is there a reason it will only show the first row of 4 in there? A common issue is the use of special characters in filenames as you have already discovered by removing periods from your filenames. Although the Supernote manuals list various characters to avoid they fail to include underscores in their list ( \_ ) which is often the culprit for custom templates not showing up. No underscores. The files that appear in the Customization page have the same format as those not appearing. Only use letters, numbers and spaces in the fielnames.

"Hey guys, just discovered e-ink devices recently and been doing some research. Even though i love the idea behind it, and am very intrigued to get one, I'm still between the fences about whether i really need one. 

Therefore, I'd like to find out what you guys are really using it for and what made you buy one. After all they aren't cheap devices and i wanna make sure I'm not wasting money. I use it as a daily planner , brain dump, sketch book , notebook all in one place. Helps me to organise my thoughts and notes beyond what I could with a regular notebook. Plus I just much prefer handwriting then typing on computer in meetings etc, I can concentrate better and also be more free in structure which helps me. Finally, the A5X is just so nice to write on that I now actually write more and I’m less precious about pages too! I should add that I also love that it’s not a tablet per say, so less distractions, blue light and need to recharge often. Not to mention no glass! I also own iPad Pro with pencil, and i love using the ipad with pencil mainly for marking up pdfs and notes. I also use it for board games (i'm a big boardgamer), in which I'll track game status/characters/etc by using PDF game sheets in Notability (ipad note taking app), and marking 'em up. BUT... I got intrigued by e-ink note takers for the better non-glass feel and to get away from staring into a computer/lit display. With that said... I'm fairly new with a rM2 and A5X. The software is generations behind iPad... but the e-ink/non-glass experience makes it worth if. Will I be solely e-ink and no iPad for note taking? Not sure. But right now, ive been 100% A5X (after starting with rM2) for about 4 weeks. Also using it for tracking workouts (I maintain a daily workout journal), general daily notes... and the keyword feature on the A5X has won me over, as it allows my to label/tag journal spots for easy searching. Software is quirky/buggy (e.g. the cloud sync functionality), but I'm hopeful (based upon Ratta's strong customer involvement/dialog) these will be ironed out and improved. Before I ve bought the A6X, I wanted to write, but the thought that pages end filled me with dread, so I didn t write. It s a poor excuse, because I do not write even after I acquired an infinite amounf of digital pages.

If I had the money, I would have definitely gone with the iPad Pro, but I am glad I didn t. 

An e-ink tablet is the perfect substitute for a notepad and that s all it is to it.

What sold it to me was the infinite pen and the community that they ve build on reddit, the last being the most important. Now, thinking about it, whatever they would sell, I would buy.

Hi u/Hex2asc,

I’ve had my A5X a few days and I think it’s fantastic. Here is some initial feedback, requests and questions:

&amp;#x200B;

**Feature requests**

* Please can we have caps lock on the keyboard
* Please can we have a way to add accents to letters in the keyboard
* There should be the ability to change the date format (eg dd/mm/yy) from the default American format of month-day
* Should be able to send PNG attachments in email. Currently, sending attachments only works with PDF, while PNG attachments are ignored
* Please can we have indented lists in Word when using bullets?

**Questions**

* In word, is there some way to erase a handwritten mark or writing?   
If I make a mistake while adding handwritten text or marking up, there seems to be no way to delete it, other than double-tapping to convert it and then deleting it after conversion, which is really laborious. It would be great to have an eraser button.

**Other feedback/bugs**

* When switching from handwriting to typing in Word or when turning on repage view, any hand writing on the page is deleted without any warning or asking to convert it first. This is a serious issue and can cause a lot of lost work.
* Backspace connect does not work as described in the manual 
* You can't rename a Word doc when it’s open the way you can with a note. This feels inconsistent
* When renaming a doc or note from the files overview, the 'x' is too far to the right (this does not affect the function, it’s just is an aesthetic UI bug)
* Deleting a document in the cloud from the browser interface does not work. You get a confirmation, but the file stays in the folder, even after sync. The only way to delete it is from the A5X device itself, which then works across the device and the cloud after syncing.

Thank you in advance for your consideration and keep up the great work! Just a quick feedback on ""Please can we have caps lock on the keyboard"".

I can simply double click the ""Shift"" (big up arrow) key. I agree for the date, it is really confusing, it should adjust based on the timezone or let us define the way we want to appear ""Deleting a document in the cloud from the browser interface does not  work.

Awesome! Somehow none of the  reviews I have watched mention the hyperlink support. And I had a very very negative experience with the Remarkable's software making me cautious purchasing cool looking but expensive products.

Is the table of contents collapsible and respecting the hierarchy? I.e. is it easy to navigate a book with four chapters but hundreds of paragraphs in the TOC? Or everything is on the same level (making it difficult to find the chapters)? If the latter, is it on the timeline to fix it?

And is there an option to search for PDF metadata? I plan to have many pdfs on the device and I would like to search for authors/title/arxiv number (if the title is long, then it's not practical to use it as a file name) etc. This fantastic mate.

"All of the other e-ink devices are available on either Android or Linux platforms. Supernote is the only device that gives you a choice because its tablets are available with either operating system. Amazing.

I’d like to know what users see as the pros and the cons of both platforms. Do Supernote’s Linux products have a faster processing speed or better latency? Do the Android devices offer better functionality? 

Why do you think one is better than the other, based on your use case? I’d love to know what Ratta thinks as well and why they are committed to producing two versions of the A6 and A5. I went with the A5X because although I don't use Kindle it seems like the Android OS has more potential for additional functionality in future. It's been working great so far - it does slow down a lot when I'm drawing and using the copy/paste and resizing features heavily but honestly I don't really mind that as drawing really isn't the primary reason I got it. I also can't comment on whether the A5 is any better in this respect - maybe someone else could add something here?

I saw it said somewhere that although the battery capacity is greater on the A5X the android OS is more demanding and so the battery life is actually lower - again I don't have a point of comparison but I certainly haven't had any issues with battery life, keeps going for multiple days.

"I preordered the A6X and I've really enjoyed it as my first ereader and note taking device. However, there are basic navigation features that would make it much easier to use.

It's annoying to flip through tens of pages when navigating through documents and digests. There should be an an option to skip multiple pages, skip to the end, and enter a page number (similar to when navigating documents). Even better would be searching for files or folders in the current directory or skipping by alphabetic ordering (skip to where Hs or Vs begin like a contact book).

It would be nice to have a back button when navigating documents. So when I open a folder, I can go back to the same page in the document navigator rather than flipping through all the pages to get back to the same page.

Most if not all good epub readers automatically embed links to footnotes, so you don't need to flip to the references pages to find the footnote. It'd be really nice if I could tap on a footnote and have the footnote appear in a little window.

One should be able to annotate digests in the document viewer, rather than navigating to the digests app.

Each of these features would improve the ease of use a lot for me. In addition, having a overview that shows a grid of all pages like the remarkable would make it much easier to navigate visually when you don’t already know which page number you want You are in luck!! All of these options are available on your device already! Taping the ellipse in the toolbar brings up the menu which the overview option which brings up page thumbnails. u/official_marcoms. Taping on the page numbers opens up the ability to jump to any page you would like. Dragging down from the top of the screen allows you to search all directories by file name, keywords or stared pages. I highly recommend running through the user manual there are a lot of hidden tools and gestures built into different parts of the device and Ratta is always listening to its users for more feedback! I think I wasn't clear on the page skipping. I don't mean the pages in a document, I mean the pages when browsing through files and folders. It would be great if the same functionality to skip to a page in a document also worked when browsing a folder of documents. I sometimes reverse the sorting so I can at least flip through each page in the list of documents from the reverse of the alphabetic order.

I like the search function, this is ends up being the best way to go. Searching in the current directory is what I usually want, but this isn't so important.

I realized the last feature is in the user manual. I was tapping digests with the stylus, but I figured out that I need to tap it with my finger to annotate a digest.",Feature Request: Navigation and Usability,title prediction

"Random notes from today's waste management class on Vermicomposting. I really like taking notes by hand I find that I remember more of the content when I draw and doolie the ideas out. This is one of the many reasons I really enjoy my supernote. It has become part of my study pattern to go back, edit and clean up the doolies a bit. After class, I will take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour adding to the notes and doodles. The post by u/teicherus of the [possible colors values](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/lmo94r/possible_color_values_for_templates/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) on the SN have me excited about the potential of the current hard wear and to see what other tools are to come! 

Additionally, I enjoyed the use of the floating toolbar, however, I wish I could turn it horizontal again.  I used to keep it docked to left hands side of notes and it was rarely in my way (right-handed). I very much like the ability to collapse it and move it freely but if I could have the choice, either in the settings or on the toolbar, to select horizontal or vertical position when free that would be awesome. Seems like it might be an easy addition?

One other thing I really love is the title page, its use for building a table of contents is perfect functionality! However, I don't like the hash marks. I would like to still be able to differentiate the title without effectively crossing them out.  Is there currently a way to disable that or a workaround anyone has found? For future updates, I personally would rather brackets around the title much like the diegest. Or even a box but the hash marks kinda kill it for me.

The only thing I miss about taking notes on paper is that I used a lot of color-coding and go back through and watercolor them. One day a super note with a color E-ink screen,... now that would be pretty sweet..

I'm trying to figure out how to get a pen that is heavier overall because I'm finding I don't press hard enough to get that feeling of resistance anymore.

You covered all of the features and attributes of the three pens extensively, including the writing experiences. Just what I needed to know. These styluses are another reason to love Supernote.

Just one thing I’m curious about — spoiler alert — I assume the HOM pen is also your favourite for drawing, but what about marking up documents where you’d use a stylus to highlight text rather than write? ... Would Lamy’s “gliding over the paper” be better here than HOM’s “digging into the paper” sensation?

Whatever the case, it’s good to see one manufacturer offering high quality pens (plural) that deliver different benefits to different users. I don't own the basic pen, only the Lamy and the HOM, but I agree with you even if my opinion isn't perhaps as strong!

Now I own the Max Lumi, too, but my go-to is still the Supernote for the calendar, general note-making and the reading smaller page-sized PDFs. I just love the feel of the screen with the HOM! The digest annotation feauture, the sharpness of the screen rendering, the ability to star your faviourites, the way you can organise a notebook, the support team, etc., make this one of the best purchases I have made in a long time, and your videos were key to that, so thanks!

"I've been on and off the last few months waiting to get the RM2, until I discovered SuperNote, and I have a few questions.

1) The A5x and A6x are basically the same exact thing, except for the size of the device? I read elsewhere on the reddit that palm-rejection is missing on the smaller one too, but it's on the road map?

&amp;#x200B;

2) As someone who will use the device for taking various notes, how much of a deal breaker is the size of the A6x vs the A5x in your opinion? I may do some lite kindle reading, but I highly doubt it.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Any general reviews, tips, tricks, etc are welcome. I haven't seen much on here, but I've spent time watching videos from CPO, MyDeepGuide, GoodeReader, and a few other channels. 1. They run the exact same firmware, so functionally yes. The screen of the smaller one/A6X is glass and the larger one/A5X is... not-glass (plastic?)... but same film on the screen. The smaller one has higher ppi. The A6X actually does have palm rejection (I use it!) I think I’ve read here the A5X that doesn’t have it yet but I’m not sure. 

2. For note taking, I would base it on your preferred size of paper notebook. I literally tried measuring it out before I bought one to get a feel for the size haha. A6X screen is basically the size of an iPad mini screen. I think it’s a great size because it’s about the size of the notebooks it replaced for me (Moleskine Large)  but it’s really dependent on what you are comfortable with. 

3. [I did a short sort-of-review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/l7rgn5/a6x_initial_reviewfirst_impressions_latency_etc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) when I got my A6X, with some photo comparisons etc. which might help you decide! I'll make sure to check out the review (I started to earlier, but got sidetracked watching some videos on the devices).

&amp;#x200B;

To try and put size into perspective, if it's a standard college-ruled notebook (or maybe a 1-inch binder) how do the devices compare? 2. Keep in mind that the A6 writing area is small. 4 and 5/8 inch by 6 and 1/8 inch. The external size of the A6X is about the size of an A5 notebook. So if you are used a Moleskine or Leuchtturm1917, you'll want to go with the A5X even though the external size of the A5X is bigger than those notebooks. 

3. If you write small like me, you may go with the 0.2 nib size. But on the A5X, the lines look a bit jagged. Ratta is working on this issue. On the A6X, the higher resolution means I find it more comfortable to write in my usual handwriting size without the cognitive dissonance of the jagged lines. But I like having the physical screen real estate of the A5X. One thing that helped me with the nib size issue is to use a finer point stylus. Those are definitely closer to A5X.

The photos in the post I linked show the A6X, open, next to Rhodia and Moleskine notebooks and a Kindle Paperwhite for reference. I don’t share the experience of the poster below at finding it small (you’ll see in the photo the screen width is about the same as a page on a Moleskine), but you sound like you’re used to much larger paper notebooks so I would skew larger!",Opinions,title prediction
"I have a 6X. When I set it down on a metal cart near my work station it goes to sleep so I could not see my notes. I was getting frustrated thinking maybe that was an intended function to save battery or something. Just realized it only happens on the metal cart. When I set it down on another surface it stay on. Maybe an interaction with the magnet that is used to trigger sleep/wake? Hi u/betterwithchem, I have the same issue on a metal Ikea balcony table. The whole A5X actually feels to stick to the table slightly when the cover flap is folded underneath. Try leaving the cover open like a normal book, instead of folding over and underneath the device. I have better results like that usually... That is definetly the sleep function the supernote has for its folio. When ever the folio closes the supernote will go to sleep and when opened it will wake up the supernote. This is done with magnets. Since the table is metal the supernote's think it's the folio in its closed position and it goes to sleep, try placing something like a book or a cardboard between the supernote and the surface to avoid that problem. Maybe even consider using a stand. /u/hex2asc Is there a way we can get a switch in the settings to disable close-to-sleep?

"I use my A5X to take notes primarily, but thinking of trying the RM2 because I have been less than impressed with battery life? Any thoughts? I have the A6X and RM2 and honestly prefer the A6X.  The RM2 seems bulky even though it isn't really.  I like how the a6x feels to write on (though I hate the new movable menu.  HATE), and the RM2 does not feel like paper.  The menus seem more difficult to navigate, though I probably just need more practice.  If yoyve already got the a5x id just stick with that. &gt;already got the a5x id just stick with that.

My thought as well. Battery life on the rM2 is great when the device is idling (not in use) when in use it's not that great, but more than enough. You might get better battery life with the rM2 (don't have both, can't compare) but the difference won't be that big, and the rM2 is more fragile (glass based screen, some people have problem with the little button because it's in a zone that easy to shock, etc.). If you have a SN and it suits your need, no need to bother with the rM2 IMO, unless battery life when idling is your main criteria. Yes, I have both, and I have to say, it's a really tough call between them, but at the moment, I'm leaning more to the A5X.

Points in the RM2's favor:
* Significantly longer battery life
* Best writing feel (in my opinion)
* Calligraphy pen (I love it!)
* Thumbnails show writing on PDFs (this is important to me because I edit a lot of PDFs and it's easier to keep track of what document I've worked on)

Points in the A5X's favor:
* Ceramic nib, no more replacing plastic nibs
* Continued platform development (calligraphy pen coming soon, along with many other developments)
* Wakes up when folio is opened

The ceramic nib is what tips my preference for the A5X: I hate the idea of having to replace nibs every two weeks to a month (depending on how much writing I'm doing) and gives me the mental freedom to write and write without thinking about how I'm wearing down the nib, or ordering new ones, and so on. The fact that Ratta is so responsive to users also stands in stark contrast with Remarkable's radio silence. I know that the Supernote platform will continue to improve, so I'm willing to wait for things like a calligraphy pen. (And they are also working on battery life -- it's never going to reach the same level as RM2's, but I wouldn't be surprised if they managed to get another day out of the existing design.)

If what you're looking for is for someone to assuage your concerns that you may have made a wrong decision, here it is: stick with the A5X, the Remarkable is not significantly better to justify forking over a ton of money for similar functionality. Yes, the battery life is better, and I love the feel, but unless the A5X's battery life is causing you major headaches, stick with what you've got.",Does anyone have Remarkable 2 and Supernote A5X?,title prediction

"I recently returned a reMarkable 2 and replaced it with the A5x. Overall I'm happy with the switch, but there are two features I REALLY miss:

1. The send to reMarkable Chrome plugin which allowed me to send pretty much any article I found online to my reMarkable as a PDF. Amazing! Any chance Ratta could offer something like that?
2. The ability to simply flip the stylus around and use the other end as an eraser. It is so much easier and more natural. And yes, I have the Lamy pen but don't use it at all because my finger often accidentally pushes the erase button. If you print from you desktop and save to your Dropbox folder (if you sync that way) it is just as quick in my experience. 

But I also am on a Mac and don’t like chrome. So I am not the most objective. 

On my iPhone I use the Instaweb browser and it prints to an a5 pdf format which i save to my Dropbox folder and it is quicker and more reliable than the remarkable app in my experience. 

I am supportive of the idea of a chrome plugin. But I think the syncing options on supernote make it unneeded Thank you for your feedbacks. I think something will be change. I haven't found the dropbox synching to be that easy to set up. And it's hard to imagine anything easier than being on a site like The Atlantic, going to the top right of the browser and clicking the button that says ""send to reMarkable"" and having it instantly appear on your tablet.

"Wondering if anyone else lately is noticing issues with the screen? I've had my A6X for about 6 - 8 months, but the last probably month or so am noticing some issues (Tried looking for similar problems but didn't see any, if I've missed this issue posted somewhere else please let me know!)

*Processing video 0vi6y64bq9q61...*

1. Not recognising touch. I've attached a video from this morning. It's not all the time, but happening probably every 2nd day now, it randomly won't recognise touch input - only pen; or vice versa. Restarting does work, but I often have to restart 2 or 3 times for it to work, and sometimes it won't restart (it just sits there refusing to accept either input). 
2. The bottom half of the screen seems to be not always responding properly to pen input. Having trouble filming this, as I notice it mostly during lectures when I'm writing a LOT in a short amount of time, and am willing to accept that it could well be me writing in a hurry and causing the issue. Occasionally when I write, the words/strokes are half missing, like a pen running out of ink. And on the right-hand size, about 1/3rd of the way down, there's a weird ""blip"" section where if I draw a straight line, it instead sometimes curves outwards (again, hard to film, it doesn't seem to do it when I want to hahaha) or if I write on lined templates near there it won't write in that spot, instead bunching the letters up behind it as if I were trying to write off the edge.

I haven't dropped, damaged, banged, spilled anything on, sat near or on a magnetic device, or in any other way I can think of caused any damages to the device, I study from home and it lives on my desk 95% of the time. Any thoughts? I'll try to get a video of the ""low ink"" issue asap. Hopefully this is just a simple thing fixed in the next update :) I have similar issues but mine do not seem as prevalent as yours. At times my A5X will not recognize a finger touch until I use the stylus first. But after I use the stylus once it usually goes back to normal. Yeah, it used to do that rarely, but this has become much more pronounced, and the only fix I can find so far is a restart (or three hahaha). It's not happening often enough to really be a huge problem or anything, but the increase has me a bit worried. And the words not writing properly at the bottom are a bit concerning too, but I'm still not sure if that's just how I'm writing, or a genuine issue. Hey mate, are you still experiencing this issue or did Rata sort it out yet? I've been looking to get one of these devices but have seen this complaint pop up a couple times and am just wondering if its an ongoing thing. I was, and ended up emailing about it, and they replaced the device. I am having some possible issues with the new one, but not sure yet if that's just me (different problem). Regardless, I absolutely love mine, even if there are a few bugs or problems. I think pretty much every company will have issues like this, but the stand-out thing for me is their customer service and support. Even with the issues, they've been fantastic at talking it out and trying to sort out the issues; plus they listen to us as customers when we suggest changes or things we'd like to see.",Screen Issues,title prediction
"I have a couple of custom Note templates I use for meetings. One has a Title/Attendee/Follow Up area at the top that I use as the first page of notes for any meeting, and then when I continue taking notes on the next page, I change to the 8mm rule stock template. Then the next time I have a new meeting for the same client or project, I switch back to my custom template for that first new meeting note page.  


So, my request(s):

&amp;#x200B;

* Can we have an option to sort templates with custom ones first when we go to template selection? That would put my three custom ones first, and then the 8mm ruled one would be immediately following, and I would not need to go to the next page of templates every single time a new meeting comes up.
* In the alternative, give us the ability to rename templates so we can then sort them in any order by name.
* This third is a long shot. Can we specify how many pages a template will be used when selected, and then the one to follow it? So, I can have my custom template selected, and when I go to the next page, it will automatically shift to the ruled template I select as the second page of any meeting. Then I'll only need to select my own template for the first page of a meeting, and not need to select any other. This should override the system default for the Note template.

Thanks! I was thinking last night how much easier it'd be to be able to sort the templates, just hold to rearrange so the most-used are first in the list or something. Most used or last used would work very well for my use case. I just hate to go to the second page of templates for no good reason almost every time I have a meeting. Agreed, I use mine mainly for study and have made up some templates for definitions or equations and some summary sheets for lectures or chapter notes, and having to keep scrolling through them all to set those up for each lecture is not quite ""annoying"" as such, but it would be simplified with the option to arrange how I'd like. It's not a hugely inconvenient thing, but I was uploading more last night and starting to realise just how many I have now, and thinking that it's going to become a bit harder to find what I want (I am a self-confessed digital-hoarder and can absolutely guarantee I'll end up with way more templates than I need or use regularly hahaha) Most used or let the user rearrange the order to their own accord.",Feature Request - Template Sort Order,title prediction

"First, I’d like to thank this forum, as it has been key for my decision to buy this fantastic device. I reserved a Remarkable last summer and changed my mind after being surprised on how responsive the Supernote community was.

I’ve used the A5X for more than 2 months now and I absolutely love it. I’m not the artist-type of user and my goal was to use it as a replacement of my work paper-based notebooks. I have to say the A5X nails it for this purpose.

However, there’s always gap for improvement and I’d like to request some improvements that will make my life easier.

1) Move pages to other notes. Believe this was already requested. To me this is a key feature as the copy-paste is not always working as expected.
2) Improvements in copy-paste. It happened to me a couple of times that I paste something on the wrong place and didn’t find the way to redo the paste. It looks like the clipboard is emptied after the paste so, if you undo it, you lose the copied data. This made me lose some selections and makes me now be very careful with the copy-paste.
3) Digest without comments. I think the digest feature has a lot of potential. I use it intensively as a marker without adding comments. When retrieving the digest I see lots of blank spaces and even an option to remove the “marked” text and keep only the comments. I’d love to have it the other way around. A version without comments, so that I can get a summarized version of the book based on the marked text.
4) Improved sensitivity on the toolbar. Not sure of this but I recently got the feeling that, since I upgraded to one of the latest versions, I need to press harder to make a selection on the toolbar (e.g. switch between the pen and the rubber). This is also a bit annoying as sometimes I have to try 2 or 3 times before getting the correct tool. I believe there has to be a way to increase its sensitivity so that’s easier to select.

I hope my comments help to improve this already-amazing device. Thanks for your feedback and great suggestions! Thanks for your sincere feedback and suggestions. Yes,  the function of moving pages to other notes , which is one of the most important features that will be available in the future, each page is independent which should be moved between different notebook freely , that is similar to a binder.   Additionally,  ""a version without comments in digest"" and ""improving the sensitivity on the toolbar"" will all been submitted  to the IT team for further optimization.   Best Regards Thanks for your quick response as usual.

I have two more requests, I've just realized:

1) Be able to remove ""Star Mark"" from the search. When I search for star marks, it finds  stars that are not viewable in the note. What I mean is that I open the note and I cannot find the start mark. I believe maybe a dot or something very small is detected as a star. As I cannot delete it from the note, I believe the best would be to be able to delete it from the search page (e.g. long press to have the option to delete)

2) Select button on the ""compressed"" floating toolbar. The compressed toolbar is a great idea but I miss the selection button, which forces me to extend it. I think it would be great to have it there together with the pen, rubber, do and undo buttons.",A5X feedback after 2 months,title prediction

"Hi Everyone,

I know these kinds of questions have been asked a lot already, but I would still prefer some feedback on my specific use-case. First things first, I am planning on buying a reader and am deciding between the A5x and the Boox Note Air. I want to use the tablet to read academic journal articles while sitting outside in the sun. Now, most of what I will be doing is just reading, though I will generally do some note-scribbling at the side of pages as well. It sounds as if the Lumi Max would be my ideal option, mainly due to its size, but I don't really want to spend $900 on this so I'm stuck between the A5x and the Note Air. Voya, and others, seem to suggest that the Note Air has a slightly better/faster reader, which, I think, would be very important for me. On the other hand, It's a bit more expensive since you have to get an extra pen and, from my understanding, does not have the same Dropbox support that the Supernote has.

Has anybody tackled the question from a similar standpoint? Would really appreciate some more thoughts.

Thanks I have owned the Lumi and the A5X and prefer the A5X because the screen is more crisp (less layers between base panel and your eyes), the pen is better, the annotation features are smart (digest and stars), it feels more durable and notebook-like, and the company is very receptive to feedback. However, Boox devices are very, very fast. Much faster than the Supernote, although I don’t mind the occasional 1-2 second delay in between gestures etc. because I love what the device stands for. The PDF reflow/crop/landscape mode features on the Boox are more advanced than what the Supernote has currently. The Boox Max Lumi and Note Air don’t feel like very well thought out devices, but their capabilities are very powerful if you know what you are doing in the Android ecosystem. 

Tl;Dr: I owned a Lumi and sold it because the text wasn’t very crisp (too many layers on the screen) and the pen sucked. The A5X is a quality, purpose built device with a perfect pen for notetaking and annotating simpler, one-column a4 PDFs but anything more complex and you will meet its limitations very quick. Some thoughts: the Boox Note Air is based on a Carta screen, it has a thin layer of glass and can break quite easily. The A5X (or Note 3) might be more durable.

A5X is more on a minimalist approach even though it's android based. 

I'd say that there is more chances that you get long term support on the A5X, Onyx tends to release new devices and to forget about older ones, that receive no software updates when new models are released. Hard to tell how Ratta will be on the long run on that front, but from what we can read, them seem to be planning to provide upgrades for longer than Onyx.",A5X vs Note Air for PDF annotating,title prediction

Just wondering how it would holdup when the tip would fall on a hard flour i.e. hardwood or paving stone when in garden. I guess time will tell.

I was torn between 6X and 5X. Mobility versus writing space. I intend to transition from A5 paper notebook BJ, of which I started the 7th now, to the SN. Have scanned in the paper BJ's converted to PDF which I intent to import to SN and create a grant index page. Planning to use/utilise/create a template for daily sheet that has some pre-set goal trackers / quotes or at least space for them that should stay on the page  for a whole month or even year as a reminder and without having to flick pages. So space would be already taken up by that and in that respect the A5x made more sense. A5x also allows more flexibility when going to draw concepts/mindmaps/process diagrams etc.

Also looking forward to using this as a learning driver. For example if one wants to learn all chemical elements you could use one layer to show an empty periodic table and then try to fill out all elements and their properties from memory on another layer and the repeat by deleting the 2nd layer without having to re-draw or print out the table structure and all that without  a paper mess and no need for a printer. I have/tried the Galaxy Tab S7 pen, the Staedtler Noris Jumbo, the HoM, and the standard Sn pen.  The HoM is fine, but the one I use most is the standard pen it came with.  I'm still eying the LAMY, for the eraser button.  But It's hard to justify spending another $60-70USD for a 4th pen (I returned the Jumbo).  

I prefer not having to replace nibs.  I do have the same question about ""impact durability"" though.  Thankfully I haven't yet had to find out.  

I really was using a daily planner template with a Tasks, Meetings-at-a-glance, Quick Notes, and Scratchpad page for every day of the year.  I've fallen out of the habit lately though and pretty much have only been using it for meeting notes.  I like your learning driver method. I also just ordered.

"Hi, everyone! I'm wondering about your experience using the proofreading tools on the Supernote.

If so - why start with a Pentagram? Am I able to turn it off in this version? I'd love a auto-draw feature like procreate has. This would make the Supernote so much more useful! It’s in the manual under Symbol recognition I believe. You can search for the star symbols in your notes/documents Thanks for the quick reply. Missed it in the manual apparently.

What I do is draw the star next to the note.  Then, I can later tap on what looks like a table of contents symbol in the top left of the menu bar, and the star symbol in the right corner of that menu, and see all of the pages I've starred in that file.

My only gripes are: 1) it doesn't always recognize the star when I draw it, and 2) it would be great if I could select some of the text what I starred so I could see it in the ToC view instead of have to jump to the page in order to read it.",What's up with the supernote converting a drawn pentagram into a perfectly drawn one?,title prediction

"I wasn't sure whether to write this post or not. I was planning on using an ewriter to organise all my notes and lists at home (I seem to generate 100's of sheets of paper). The problem for me is it's for personal use and so not offset against tax etc which means I'm fairly price sensitive and these things are unfortunately close to the limit of what I'll pay.

Getting unbiased info on these devices is quite difficult. The youtube reviewers were very positive on the A5X but then they were very positive on every ewriter they reviewed which didn't really help me much. I ended up trawling through hours of reviews trying to work out the pros and cons of every device and tried to work out what would suit me best. In the end I chose the A5X as I liked the design, the ease of use and the extra functionality that keeps getting added. 

Two days ago I thought damn it, I'll just buy it. I knew the discount price was finished and had convinced myself that the full price was worth it. Then a shipping charge of $57 got added. I figured I better check the functionality to make sure I'm getting exactly what I want and stopped the order. A day later, I'd got the answers I needed here, and I thought I should still go ahead and place my order. I picked the standard package. OK'ed the shipping price, then was told about possible extra taxes etc to the UK. I gave up at that point.

I'm sure the A5X is great but I can't test it before buying and it seems I can't even work out what I'm I'll actually be paying. I decided not go ahead and instead just rely on paper and pencil for the moment. Hopefully it will appear on Amazon in the future and hopefully I'll be able to afford it. I hear you. It's expensive. All these ewriters are. And it's certainly not essential. It's a tough call. I decided (i.e., believe without actually trying yet) that it will work for what I'm looking for (one thing is to free me from needing to sit in front of my computer to read and annotate long PDFs). But I agree that it would be so much nicer to have a model one could try first. If I were you I'd stay connected here because if a deal on a used device comes available, your best bet for hearing about it will be right here. I decided to go ahead and order (with all the extra shipping and taxes to Canada), because I think this will make a big difference in my workflow (for my actual job).

I definitely intend to use the first 30 days (during which it can be returned for full refund) to see if I like it, and it provides the functionality I want/need. As you pointed out, buying expensive ""toys"" without being able to try them first is a bit of a leap, but I have NO PROBLEMS shipping it back for a refund if I decide it won't work for me. Frankly, if more people insisted on good return policies, I think we'd all feel better about buying new/unavailable tech (since we would have the comfort of knowing that it isn't money flushed down the toilet if it ends up not working for us). I would look for a used one if you are really price-conscious. I bought one used for about $40 under the price of new. You may have to wait a little bit, but it is possible. There is a thread for used ones for sale.

I would look for the thread here that has used devices for sale. Exactly. The A5 (non-X) can sometimes be found at a very decent price, it could be an alternative if budget is important and a more minimalist device can work out fine for your needs, [u/mike\_bike\_kite](https://www.reddit.com/user/mike_bike_kite/)",Information and pricing,title prediction

"Hi,  


I have just watched a [video](https://youtu.be/CXjYHtfDP6A?t=2372) where a PDF, filled with hyperlinks is used almost as if it was an app. I believe this is very similar to the zettelkasten feature which I've read about on the subreddit.

  
This idea got me really excited and upon arriving at the section which shows the PDF on the A5X (which I preordered) it is clearly mentioned and shown that you cannot follow hyperlinks with a single tap. There's always that menu which shows ""Jump To"" which you have to tap again.  
Is it possible to configure this (or change the default) behaviour? If not, I would like to request this :-)  
It should be easy to implement and could very well live alongside the actual zettelkasten feature.

&amp;#x200B;

thanks,

Crucidal [deleted] The inner hyperlinks within the documents are available on Supernote A5X, the prompt of "" Jump to“ ， which designs to avoid unintentional touch which caused to jump to a certain hyperlink page by accident, which might also cause some "" inconvenience"". I agree that there is an inconvenience in both scenarios. However, the touch is not over sensitive and in my experience, being able to hit the hyperlink is enough secure in itself to avoid most unintentional jumping. To me it would be awesome with an option to turn this off, just like you can turn off touch recognition. The power of freedom and customization :) My current experience is purely from e-readers like the kindle paperwhite.(is it fair to assume this would translate to the a5X as well?)I've never experienced unintentional touches there. The palm rejection should ""fix"" other scenarios in which you might accidentally press a hyperlink.It seems like the Jump To was built to prevent ""annoyance"" for a use case that probably rarely happens in comparison to how often you intentionally press it.

Handling unintentional navigation could also be solved by providing a means to quickly go back to the previously shown page. either by a temporarily hovering menu or a built-in shortcut (like double tapping the lower left corner or something)Purely looking at ""handling unintentional navigation"" my suggestion takes 2 page refreshes and that's definitely slower than the ""jump to"" menu. But if you would multiply this by some weight which represents how often you unintentionally navigate vs intentionally, I think it would outweigh the drawbacks :-)","feature request: A5X directly follow internal links without showing ""Jump to"" menu?",title prediction

"Hi r/Supernote. 

&amp;#x200B;

I purchased my Supernote A5X in January and have been using it for a few months now. I absolutely love it. I basically don't use real paper anymore. Over the past several months, my Supernote has become one of my most precious items -- I carry it around with me everywhere. It contains my calendar (actually, Voya's calendar, it's really great!), my todo lists, my personal journal and diary, my work documents, and my school documents and papers. The Supernote team should feel proud that they have created and commercialized such a fabulous device. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to suggest some features, but I don't want to imply that I'm not fully satisfied with the product. The Supernote has brought me alot of joy and I really am happy. In the future, here's what my perfect Supernote device would look like:

&amp;#x200B;

Reading &amp; Note Taking Improvements:

* **Split Screen View.** I wish I could view a document and a note side-by-side at the same time, especially if I turned my Supernote sideways.
* **No annotation tag.** Annotations in PDFs have a small circular ""D"" or ""A"" symbol at the end of each selection that blocks the text underneath. Do we really need these symbols? It would be great to turn them off, or to somehow move them to the side so I can read the text underneath. 
* **Improve the Underlining/Annotating Experience.** When trying to underline a sentence in a PDF, it is too easy to grab (1) the leading whitespace before the first word or (2) the trailing whitespace after the last word or period. It would be great if Supernote was smart enough to omit leading and trailing whitespace characters when underlining.
* **Free the Title.** In a Note, do ""Titles"" really need to be obscured with dark diagonal slashes? What is the point of hiding the text underneath the Title? Perhaps I don't understand this function. Wouldn't it be better if, instead, the text was surrounded by a box that you could see through? Why do I want dark squares in my Note? Why do I want to hide the Title?
* **Change the Lasso Icons.** I feel like the lasso icons are backwards. After I lasso a word or phrase in a Note, the box with a ""T"" in it is *not* for ""Title"" -- it creates a keyword. And the box with ""dots and lines"" is not to create keywords, but to create a ""Title"". I keep getting these mixed up because ""T"" = ""Title"". Am I thinking about this wrong?  I feel like these icons should be swapped, or changed completely.
* **Use UTF-8 Encoding in Digest.** The Digest does no seem to have a full set of UTF-8 fonts. For example, the South Korean won symbol, ₩, does not show correctly in the Digest.

&amp;#x200B;

PDF Improvements:

* **PDF to Note copying.** I want to be able to copy text from an annotation/digest (i.e., the text that I have underlined) and paste it into a Note file.  
* **PDF Snip Tool.** I wish I could lasso an area of a PDF and the copy that over to a Note as an image. 
* **Add Layers to PDFs.** Right now, layers only work in Notes. It would be nice to be able to use layers on top of PDFs. 
* **Copy Written Doodles from PDF to Note.** I wish I could write a little note and/or doodle in a PDF and then cut/copy that into a Note. 
* **Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus.** I want a dictionary and thesaurus feature for PDFs and ePubs (and, Notes?). The Kindle app comes bundled with one, but I can't use that feature outside of Kindle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Potential Bugs:

* **Fix E-mail Typo.** When you enter an incorrect e-mail address (e.g., ""supernote@.com"" is an incorrect e-mail address format) then the error message says ""Please check mailbox"" instead of ""please check e-mail address.""
* **Clean up Keywords.** In a Note, when I lasso a word and mark it as a keyword, it appears as a keyword in the menu. Great. But, when I erase the keyword in the Note, the keyword still appears in the menu. Is that normal? 

&amp;#x200B;

Miscellaneous / Other:

* **Creating geometry.** I want to be able to tap two points on my Supernote device with the pen and have a straight line drawn between them. That's it. That's the feature. I just want to draw straight lines between two arbitrary points. 
* **Creating tables.** I want to be able to tap on my Supernote device with the pen and drag it down to create a table (e.g., a 3x3 or 5x5 or 7x7 table). 
* **Search for Keywords in Digest.** I wish I could search for some text in my Digest (not the notes I make in my Digest, but rather the digest printed text itself). 
* **More Quick Access.** Right now, Supernote only allows 4 Documents and/or Notes in the Quick Access area. I wish I could have a more, especially since adding a 5th document/note completely removes the 1st, and unlinking the 5th does not restore the original 1st. 
* **Quick Access List Reordering.** I wish I could reorder the documents and notes shown in the Quick Access list. But this only makes sense if the documents/notes in the Quick Access area are some how ""sticky"" or ""permanent"". My A5x is scheduled to arrive Monday, and this list looks like a great way to help me get started (in terms of ""things that might not work the way I thought they would""). I hope the supernote team sees this, are they active here? Can you actually ""page"" them so they can be sure to see it? This is a great, carefully considered list of requests and I agree with the vast majority of them.

The biggest one, for me, is the ability to draw straight lines between two points. That would solve a big pain point.

Otherwise, like you, I love this thing. Three months in and it’s now indispensable. Yeah, I use a ruler to draw straight lines, like on pen and paper! xD Super notes does review comments, I was hoping they came out with a calendar with reminders.

Thanks!! Square brackets? These create a separate doc called a digest where you can add your notes relating to that section of the pdf. You click on the text to take you to the digest page.

Received custom import tax payment request via email from DHL on 30. April 7:05 am GMT. Paid right after, process was straight forward. (€129 for Ireland with 23% VAT).

"Hi all

*I posted similar to the below in the remarkable subreddit not realising a5x had a sub.

I'm a Psychologist based in Australia and I'm looking to go digital with my in session note taking. I'm looking for some advice as there's a lot of options.

I think I'm leaning towards the a5x or papyr. I've been watching morning coach and my deep guide most of the morning and it seems that these two devices have improved since release/have good customer service.

How would the a5x go with the below?

Priority
- Note taking/writing is #1 for sure
- Custom note templates (I use a session note template)
- Ability to easily erase what I write
- Ability to export/email my notes to my computer
----- If I could export to a specific folder on my computer that would be ideal
- Ability to create flowcharts/diagrams etc easily as I often use a whiteboard in session

Bonus features
- Would be great if I could export my notes to a specific folder on my computer
- I often put a sticky note on my session note to remind me of things to bring up with the client, but I'm not sure if any device could replicate this?
- Being able to bring up pdfs/highlight and write on them
- Ability to screenshare
- Ability to create a to do list
- Handwriting to text. My hand writing is pretty chicken scratch, but this could be useful in future as I write the same words a lot (so text prediction too)

If anyone has any other suggestions I would be more than happy to hear them. I love my A5X and think it checks off all of your must have boxes and many of your bonus features as well. 

* I really like the writing experience and find it very natural and easy to write on. 
* You can set the note template to be anything you want. There are tons of community created templates and creating custom ones is very simple and straight forward. 
* If you go with the standard or HOM supernote pens, you don't get an eraser button but I don't find it a hassle to switch to the eraser  in the tool bar. I also like the lasso eraser feature a lot and find it easy to use. 
* I have my supernote synced via dropbox. So whenever I choose, all of the files are synced to my computer for reference. You can set up specific folders in dropbox and the files will transfer flawlessly between them. I've never had an easier cloud-syncing experience. 
* I'm not quite sure what you mean by creating diagrams. With Supernote, you are able to draw like you would on a piece of paper. They've hinted at potentially adding drag and drop shapes to notes as well.
* Supernote has several options for marking up and bookmarking documents so you can go back to them later. This might work fo you. 
* You can bring up and write on PDFs. Highlighting is a little strange because its only B/W but it does work.
* Screen sharing is not an option :(
* There are to do list templates and quick access features that make to do lists a breeze to create and update on supernote. 
* I think they are working on handwriting to text for notes but it's not an option yet. 

I cannot recommend supernote enough. I really like the design decisions that Ratta made. The pen loop and aluminum rail system keep the pen and device attached to the folio in a more secure way than magnets do. The writing experience feels great. And the supernote team has been so responsive and listens to the community. This is massively helpful - thank you. You've answered everything so I really appreciate it. I'll have to make though I can avoid using the cloud when it comes to client related notes while still having the ability to export/email them to myself. So I'll ask supernote about that. You can also transfer via usb. 

There is an email function, and I assume that you can send attachments via it (but I haven't used it as I wanted a distraction free device for writing)",Questions on a5x features,title prediction
"Hello Supernote users! I recently updated my Supernote A5X (the day after the newest update came out) and the new features are really great additions. However... the past two days I noticed immense battery drainage. I left my half-charged (give or take) Supernote overnight, waking up to 6%. The day after, left an 85% charged device, only to find it at 55%. Now, this is a HUGE battery drainage problem... and if this is coming from the update, I'm wondering if anyone else had noticed it AND if anyone has considered going down one update for this very reason? As much as I like being able to save my notes as a vector, the last thing I need is my device to feel like my phone, something to constantly be worried about with battery life.

"Hi Can we turn off the jump to request? I have hyperlinked PDF files and I would like to navigate a tad faster by clicking only once?

PS. In love with my A5X xx Our team has discussed this internally. The reason why there is no direct jump is that we lack a shortcut for ""go back"". If the user accidentally triggers the jump, it is inconvenient to return to the previous page. We are developing a convenient way to go back, and at that time, we will enable direct jumps. :) Perfect, thanks ! That's an interesting problem. I know I'm biased here, but I imagine the number of users wanting to go forward with one click far outweighs the number of exceptions of a miss click.

It's just a shame to see videos of the REmarkable clicking through at a high pace for a nice UX feel and the A5X having that friction of double touch...even though you've already built the equivalent capability.

I am being tempted by the Remarkable's texture and pen tool.  Convince me otherwise!

I have ordered the LAMY pen to compare the difference and ordered the Remarkable knowing I can return.  I do a LOT of drawing and my senses are highly sensitive.  I thought I read somewhere about someone who's screen was more textures on. one device than another.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there a way to get a more textured (less slick) drawing experience on the Supernote? Screen protector? Pen?
2. Anyone know if there is a Pencil tool in the works?

(Please know, as much as I am enjoying RM2, Supernote has my heart) No and I don’t know. Just stick with the RM2 if you like drawing. 1.No, you can't add a screen protector because you already have one and you can't remove it because the ceramic pen works with it. For me the first advantage of the ceramic tip is that the tip is thinner.

2) Yes, the pencil brush will be available soon and I look forward to it. The algorithm is done since the beginning of the year, you can see a demo on Supernote's Twitter here :

"I know another one of these threads. I promise I read through as much as I could before posting here but want some fresh perspectives on this given my needs with a device like this.

Both of these devices seem great but I'm torn on which one to get. For my use, I'll only be writing (no drawing or sketching) and I'll primarily be using the device for work meeting notes, to do lists, and daily bullet journaling. I will not use the eReader functionality (already have a Kindle for that) or the PDF viewer/markup functionality. This will be a purely writing device for me. I watched some YouTube videos and both have pros and cons and I can't figure out which one is best for my use. 

The reMarkable 2 looks beautiful and is super thin, which is nice. I also like its UI much better than the Supernote UI - I don't feel like I'll be multi-tasking on a device like this much as I won't be going back and forth between a PDF and notes or anything like that and I don't mind a couple extra presses to get back to my notes (though it looks like rm2's upcoming 2.7 firmware is going to add improved navigation for quickly switching between documents too). The rm2 also has the better OCR, which is something I know I'll use frequently. I already used this often on my Surface to convert handwritten notes. The remarkable 2 also exports writing in a non-rasterized format which is a nice pro. 

The A5X has much better organization options like bookmarks and searching - which would be immensely helpful. The pen is also looking like a huge plus here. I love real luxury pens and own a few fountain pens. So the options Supernote offers are really nice. Plus not ever having to replace the nib is huge and seems like it'd be a nice money save over time. The Supernote also seems to make templates much easier to create and use - which I would for things like my bullet journaling.

My final concerns are price and support. I could use a referral code for the rm2 and get it for over $100 cheaper than the A5X. But I've also heard bad stories of remarkable's support and it's nice to see Supernote engaging with the community. But I also worry that despite that engagement, if something goes wrong I have to send things back overseas which could be expensive or cause long delays (I'm in the US).

Would love to hear the thoughts of people who were trying to decide between the two as well. Especially if you use your device similar to how I described I would above. Thanks! Tough call. Personally, I ended up returning my RM2 and went for the Supernote, see my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/n2ieu3/advice_a5x_vs_rm2/gwyemv3/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Then again, my use case is different.

Why don't you try out the Remarkable and see how you like it? (They offer free returns, after all.)

One thing I'd keep in mind: The writing experience. This is a very personal thing and, personally, I prefer the feeling of the Supernote. &gt; see my comment here

Thanks for that. Helpful. Your points about the areas rm2 wins are also things to consider. Seems like the responsiveness is better. Also the recent 2.6 update seems to have fixed the jagged lines issue on the remarkable. 

&gt; Why don't you try out the Remarkable and see how you like it? (They offer free returns, after all.)

This is a good point. Though I'd feel bad about using someone's referral code only to return the device so they don't get the credit.

Honestly though, if the Remarkable 2 had bookmarks and tags that were searchable it'd probably win for me pretty easily. Though I'd still be lusting after the Supernote's pens and nibs you don't need to replace. I use my device primarily for note taking and planning.  (Consulting on clients). I also purchased both to see which would be better.  SUPERNOTE won.  For me it came to writing, my handwriting needed a .5 and the RM2 was not fine enough and when I switched to the pencil thin, it was too light and hard to read.  As much as I liked the look and feel, it was a deal breaker.  Also, the nib replacement just seemed a hassle.  Love the durability of Supernote.  Supernote can save to cloud or OneDrive which I like, but there is a lot more storage on Supernote than RM2.
Would like to see more “helpful” hints from the company but right now the 3rd party people are doing a nice job for me.
Hope this helps! Thanks. I appreciate this perspective. The pen is a huge reason why I'm still unsure which one to go with. The Supernote's pens all seem superior to anything else on the market - both in feeling like a real pen and also the thinness of the nib. Definitely something I'm putting a lot of weight behind. But so much else about the rm2 seems better for my use cases.",Supernote A5X or reMarkable 2?,title prediction

"Hello Supernote team!  
I just recently purchased a used Supernote device and love the fact that you promote the second hand market for Supernote devices, instead of trying to squash it (I am looking at you Apple!). The ability to buy and sell Supernote devices is amazing because it not only gives a Supernote buying ""*insurance""*  that they can sell the device if it does not work for them, or help those who cannot pay full price afford one, but it also helps keep ewaste out of the landfills.   


That said, while going through the process of finalizing a deal there we were a couple things that concerned/annoyed me though.   
1. Very few rules - Normally anytime you are buying and selling something on Reddit the subreddit has strict rules that help prevent scams. Some of these include recent timestamped photos, addition to the universal scammer list, only allowing payment through paypal goods and services, having the buyer/seller say which state they live in, and a flair that shows how many trades a user has. A perfect example of these rules is r/hardwareswap and r/AVexchange. Implementing some of these rules would greatly help everyone avoid scams.  


2. Hard to find people selling - People who were selling their devices often not only used the trades mega thread but also made new posts or commented on other posts. This caused an issue where it was hard to know if you were seeing all the people interested in selling their devices or not.   


3. Vague price history - Often times the original post showing the final sale price was gone so it was hard to determine what a good deal was or not. Making sure these stay up would greatly help everyone know they are getting a good deal. 

4. Sellers not including screenshots or condition - Most of the time sellers did not include a link to pictures/timestamps of their device so it was hard to detriment what exactly they were selling in what condition.   


Ways to implement these suggestions:  
I think that the best possible way to keep the Supernote market safe and avoid blocking out other content in this subreddit is to create a new subreddit specifically for buying/selling/trading Supernote devices. This new subreddit would then be added to the USL (universal scammers list) and would have strict rules on how people can make posts. Any person who wanted to buy/sell a device could then make a post and the seller/buyer could sort these posts by new in the subreddit getting an up to date list of the resent buying/selling requests. Flairs could be added to further improve the process with Buying, Selling, and Closed tags being used to show the status of a post. Lastly, each post would be able to include pictures and a detailed title so that the buyer and seller can meet quickly and effectively.  


Thanks so much for reading our feedback! I hope this post is helpful. Thank you for sharing your opinion with us, to avoid scams and make our users can get a Supernote device through a trustful channel is our wishes. Hope our users can be more cautious and prudent during the transactions of a used device. What we can do is limited at this stage, look forward to a chance to discuss more with you in the future.

"I've had an issue with my Supernote A5 since I got it almost a year ago and I was wondering if anybody else had the same problem.

I cannot charge the device with a USB-C to USB-C cable. It works fine with the included USB-A to USB-C cable, and with any other A to C cable I've tried. But if the cable is USB-C on both ends (like the MacBook charger) absolutely nothing happens. I've tried this with multiple cables and multiple transformers with the same (lack of) results.

Does anyone else have this issue, or do I have a faulty device? This is frustrating because it means I need a dedicated charger for my Supernote, while the rest of my devices (laptop, phone, keyboard, etc) can all charge from the same cable. If it is a problem with the device, is there any way to get a fix or replacement? Bit surprised you haven't contacted CS if it's been happening for almost a year. I think there were a few customers who had problems with the included cable last year but it can't be that if you've tried multiple cables and chargers. 

Feedback to customer service, via your device, is your best course of action. There are the usual things to try, hard reset, swapping cable around, clean the port (but then you've got it to work with USB-A) etc or it could be a software fault. I'm sure they'll help you resolve your problem I was actually waiting until I got around to getting another cable and adapter to test it out before contacting customer service, and to make sure it wasn't just something about the the USB hardware they use.

I'll contact them, thanks.

I use my Supernote A5 for a lot of grading, and overall it works great for getting feedback to students. I don't use Google Classroom but I can speak to the other aspects of the workflow.

The workflow is a little awkward, however. It's easy enough to get a folder full of PDFs of the student submissions onto the device and to mark them up. But because the Supernote wants to leave the original PDF untouched, you need to export each marked-up document individually (as far as I know there is no way to export an entire folder in one action). This takes usually betweeen 5 and 30 seconds per document depending on its length, which interrupts the grading flow a bit. The exported files are in a totally different directory, named the same as the original document. I usually end up manually copying these files somewhere to be uploaded back to my LMS.

I would **love** it if they implemented an ""export entire folder"" option, or else if there were some way to have the exporting of marked-up PDFs happen automatically in the background.

There might be a smoother workflow with Word .docx files if you get an X-series Supernote.

Still, the Supernote has made marking up student papers and essays *much* easier overall. I no longer need to either (a) print them all out or (b) fiddle with PDF markup on my computer.

Hope this helps a bit! Thank you. This definitely helps! How do your students feel about your comments? Are they able to see and read them easily? Aside from my bad handwriting, yes!

The annotations are a bit pixelated but nobody seems to have had an issue yet. Also, I think the pixelation issue has been solved on the X-series with vector-based exports (which is allegedly coming to the A5 … *eventually*?)",Question about use with Google Classroom/Drive,title prediction
" Hi! Since this morning I’m having a problem when trying to update my a5x, and some more issue. When I try to update it (I’m still at 238 version), through settings&gt;system&gt;software update&gt;check, it just tells me the device is updated. Wifi connection, of course, is on, and I can check my email, but I cannot synchronize though supernote cloud, because when I try, it immediately opens the last doc I read. And finally, if I try to upload the log (system&gt;feedback&gt;upload logs), it tells me “upload failed”. I restart and reboot 3 times, and no variations. Please, give me some indications about what I’m supposed to do. Thanks It should've updated around two weeks ago. My advice is to contact customer service via email and include your device number.

" Thanks a lot! Very good video as always :) I agree with you, it may be missing an option to choose the type of eraser but anyway we will enjoy it ! Just have to be patient for the ""X"" owners. I'm using the 5X this morning, and really miss the erase gesture already! lol Could you tell us if this gesture is possible to execute while holding the device in one hand and writing with the other? Or are you forced to put down the device on your lap or table? I wonder if this specific use case was a part of the troubleshooting when Supernote developed this gesture, u/mulan_sn or u/hex2asc? I've been trying to imitate the gesture on my A6X, but find it a bit difficult to find a natural/working way for two fingers to touch while holding the device in my left hand and the pen in my right hand. The whole premise of the two finger gesture suggests that you have a free hand available in the first place but it's *not impossible* to get two fingers on the screen using the hand holding the device. 

However, as stated from your own trial, it's really awkward and very uncomfortable to get the finger positioning right to successfully activate the function. 

The developers have done a lot of work to refine the gesture and activation zones to prevent as much accidental or false positive activation as possible due to extra stray fingers on the screen including the writing hand making contact with the screen while writing.",Supernote A5 and A6 UPDATE!

"I was just eagerly waiting for my Supernote to be shipped. The long waiting time is not great but is something I understood but I had to cancel my order 3 days before shipping since I looked randomly into the return policy.  Not free return policy and good will return for such devices is just not what I expect. Do you by any chance live in the US?

I read complaints about a lack of free international returns but tbh that's not the norm where I live and, I think, a lot of the world... so calling it *a joke* is a bit harsh and a little US (and maybe EU?)-centric. If I bought a Remarkable, for example, their free return policy wouldn't apply to me since I live in Asia. I guess I would wait for them to set up US/EU warehouses for cheaper shipping in your case.

Edit: The only places I know of here with free international returns are big companies like Lazada (owned by Alibaba; think Amazon) that do logistics in massive volume. How long does this company take to ship? I ordered my A6 X four days ago and have yet to receive a confirmation email. I have only gotten the PayPal receipt. I know they are supposed to have good customer service, but I would at least like to know that my order is being processed. Usually ships within a few days and as far as I remember they sent me a despatch email ( though that doesn't always mean the parcel is physically with the carrier.) I do remember that the tracking was slow to update. See whether anything comes through by Monday then pop them an email to check. Could be they're just busy. Appreciate that we'd all like a free return. However, some people buy it just to try it out, some order at least two devices from different companies with the sole intention of only keeping one. They are a relatively new company, so if a lot of people send devices back, they're losing money. Perhaps, one day they'll be in a position to but likely it could increase the cost for others.

There is the option of selling it, as others have done.

Method 1: Then click the PDF on the cloud page, it will automatically download the exported PDF after clicking and converting (with the .mark files)   
  
Please do not download from the cloud directly without the above steps, otherwise, it is possibly to download the original “blank” pdf without annotations.  
   
Method 2: You can also open/click the exported pdf with annotation from the My device-&gt; Export folders, (The exported pdf will be downloaded automatically)  
  
Additionally，when exporting the PDF on the device, whether you choose “original” or “Vector”. For a vector pdf, If the pdf parsing software cannot open it ( or open without annotation), please try to open it directly with a browser.  
Not sure that whether it is clear enough, please try it. It worked - Thank you!!

Mike I don't have my device yet - it's currently in transit from China. So I can't help you with the first couple. But the pen is not magnetic. They recommend you use the case because it has the pen holder loop on the side for it. 

And as far as I know, the Kindle app only lets you connect to the Kindle service. I'm *pretty sure* you have to use the built in reader to read epub and pdf files you transfer to the device. 1- You don't need the Kindle app to view ebooks. Kindle app is only for accessing kindle books. Supernote can read most ebook formats. Edit: To use LAN, you need the Supernote Partner App.

2- You can put those files anywhere. But the ideal place to do it is in the Documents folder. Putting them in the Notes folder may cause some confusion.

3- Check your email or spam for a privacy or insecure connection alert to enable it.

4- No. You can keep the cap in the pen loop. If you have the standard pen and not HOM, it will be roomy in the pen loop. Many thanks.

Don't suppose you know why the USB won't connect? It seems I can write to the supernote cloud drive and then sync.

"Hello

I have supernote A5x and A6x. I need the two devices to have the same content.

I'm logged in on both devices with the same account (email address). They are not mirroring. on the ratta supernote cloud, it only shows the A6x's content

I've tried to log out and log in on A5x: doesn't work... 

what do I have to do ? Curious about this question myself.  Thinking of getting an A6X for the smaller form factor.  But if they are treated as completely discrete devices and there are no seamless integration options, despite them sharing the same email account, why not consider a non-Sn as a second device just for variety? X series can share the same account(login with one account), while the non-X series can share the same account. You can log in on your new device with your existing Supernote account.  
  
Users need to be careful to keep both devices in sync with each other. Generally, the steps are like following:  
1: A6X writes notes  
2: A6X  sync  
3：A5X sync  
4: A5X writes notes again.  
.......  
Repeat the above steps

I second this. I have an A6X and A5X and they sync with each other fine. Same for me. I have A5X and A6X, and the content syncs fine.

Re Google. Sure it's been mentioned/requested, so believe it'll be possibility in a future update but don't take this as gospel. I work with two devices A5x and A6x, and they can be synced if you what entails correspond to your needs:

1. **Sync is manual, and therefore, not real time**. That means that when you do a change on your device you need to do **every time** you want to use ""collaborative"" documents.
   1. press the sync button on the top drawer, to check if any change has been made since the last sync by someone else
   2. make the changes you need to do
   3. press again the sync button to make sure what on the cloud mirror the content of your device
   4. hoping that no one is doing the same on another device (see 3 below)
2. **Sync does sync the notes but not the ""smart annotation""**. See here point 3, on my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/nnr2nv/do_annotations_exist_outside_my_a5x_or_a6x_device/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). If that's what you need upvote the post linked.
3. **Sync granularity is the file level**, I think, but unsure. I, personally, notice that if I want to sync two devices at the same time, there is an alert on the second one, saying that the cloud is already busy syncing on another device. **What I fear it means is that** : during the time device A is syncing (making some useful changes; let's say to your task list), you can't sync. Then, when the cloud is done syncing A, you start syncing your device B. If, for some reason, the changes you made to the task list on device B is ulterior to the one made on device A, that (probably) means, you'll overwrite changes made by device A, **losing device A changes**.

Based on these remarks, and the fact that you have a team of 8 people (imagine this hassle is x8), **I would recommend going for a device that as a granularity of stroke change, and is in ""real time""**.

If you want to stay in e-inks, I would therefore recommend looking **Mobiscribe Origin: MobiShare**. Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/K35CFZlKC9M) testing the sharing capabilities.
